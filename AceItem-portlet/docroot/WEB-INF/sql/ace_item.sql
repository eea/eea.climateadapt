Key Approaches					                					Knowledge-based                    									3. Experiences that can be exchanged									A new method makes it possible for the costs and benefits of investments in flood protection to be more carefully weighed against one another. It also offers the possibility for setting standards for high water protection in the future. The method can be applied to any dyke ring areas, to compare flood risk with other collective risks.									4. Overview of the case									The ‘’Flood Risks and Safety in the Netherlands’’ undertaking has resulted in the development of new methods which can be used to calculate both the probability and consequences of flooding. 									5. Context and Objectives									a) Context									One of the risks of living in the Netherlands is that the country is vulnerable to floods but because of major technological advances it is possible to make the flood probability very small. Therefore the Dutch no longer consider floods as a natural disaster, but as a disaster caused by humankind. It may never be possible to prevent flooding entirely, but people can largely determine for themselves to what extent they want to control the risk. This makes it possible and, indeed, necessary to make a conscious choice about the costs and benefits of high water protection. The benefits are fewer victims and less damage when flooding does occur. In the 1950s, the Delta Committee established that extremely high water levels constitute the greatest threat of flooding. This insight provided the basis for safety standards for water defences until the present. The current safety standards for water defences were derived on the basis of the size of the population and the economic importance of South Holland in the 1950s. For regions with fewer inhabitants and of less economic value, lower standards were set at the time. However, this assumption is now no longer universally applicable. The probability of flooding due to high water levels is now regarded as small compared with the risk due to other flood failure mechanisms. Therefore, in 2000, the Dutch government decided to determine the probability and consequences of flooding throughout the Netherlands of the so-called dyke ring areas. A dyke ring is an unbroken ring of water defences and high ground and the area protected by the dyke ring is called the dyke ring area. At the start of the study there were 53 dyke ring areas in the Netherlands. In 2005 the Water Defences Act was revised, with new dyke ring areas being designated and now there are 95 dyke ring areas in total designated in the legislation.									b) Objectives									The purpose of the work was to gain an understanding of the consequences and the probability of flooding in the Netherlands. The underlying aim was that, apart from evaluating the probability of a certain water level being exceeded (which is the measure currently used to assess dykes), other failure mechanisms were also taken into consideration. At the same time, the potential consequences of flooding were also investigated. It was also used to calculate the consequences of flooding when deciding upon strengthening of the water defences.									6. Implementation of the ICZM Approach (i.e. management, tools, resources)									a) Management									The Flood Risks and Safety in the Netherlands (VNK1 or Floris) initiative was begun in 2001 at the request of the State Secretary of Transport, Public Works and Water Management. The project was conducted by the Road and Hydraulic Engineering Institute of the Directorate-General for Public Works and Water Management, in close cooperation with the Water Boards and Provinces. It ended in 2005 and, currently VNK2 (since 2007) is using an improved methodology and aims to have detailed information on flood risks and flood probabilities by 2014.									b) ICZM tools									The product of the Floris study is a method which can be used to calculate flood risks in a consistent manner. Four routes were taken to achieve the objectives: 																																determining the probability of flooding for all dyke ring areas;													gaining an understanding of the problems affecting hydraulic structures;													gaining an understanding of the possible consequences of flooding;													obtaining an impression of the uncertainties and an indication of how to deal with them.																															During the work, it was therefore decided to undertake the assignment in phases. During the first phase of the project the probabilities of flooding, consequences and risks were calculated for 16 of the 53 dyke ring areas that defend the Netherlands from flooding. These 16 dyke ring areas were chosen because they would give a fairly representative picture of the national situation. The consequences of flooding were calculated at a detailed level for three of them and more roughly estimated for the remaining 13 areas. 									Existing methods were adapted and new methods developed. These new methods were necessary, for example, to assess hydraulic structures and the impacts on wildlife, the landscape, cultural heritage and the environment. A unified method was also developed to be able to turn all water defences into data for input into models The loads from water levels, currents and waves were calculated in the same way for all dyke ring areas. For some components the methods will need to be developed further. For example, it would be desirable to include the effect of human intervention during high water levels in the flood risk, to reduce the uncertainties in the probability of piping where the water forms channels under the dyke causing it to collapse and to calculate the failure probability of several other water defences. 									The calculated probability of flooding was shown to range from 1:2500/yr for parts of the Randstad or western conurbation to more than 1:100/yr. in the rivers region. The calculations do, however, provide the opportunity to analyse which failure mechanisms contribute most in the flooding probability and where the weakest locations are in the dyke ring. The work also showed that, in order to be able to interpret the calculated probability of flooding properly it is necessary to have a detailed knowledge of the area. For example, the calculations for Terschelling (a Wadden island) resulted in a failure probability due to piping of 1/600 per year. However, the extensive Wadden mud flats in front of the dyke would largely prevent this phenomenon. When this effect is taken into account, the calculations result in a failure probability of only 1/64,000. With the methodology, it is possible to get an impression of where investments in water defences will make the most contribution to reducing the risk of flooding.									7. Cost and resources									There is no information about the costing of the Floris initiative. With respect to flooding, the maximum economic damage of a failed dyke ring area ranges from €160 million in Terschelling to almost €300 billion in the province of South Holland. Flood risk (i.e. the flood damage multiplied by the probability of flooding) has also been calculated. The amount that should be set aside per year to be able, in the long term, to compensate for the damage caused by flooding in the three dyke ring areas, calculated in detail, ranges from €2 - 37 million/yr. In the other 13 dyke ring areas, a more approximate calculation shows a range from €100,000 - 180 million/yr.									8. Effectiveness (i.e. were the foreseen goals/objectives of the work reached?)									In most dyke ring areas, the failure mechanism of ‘piping’ was shown to constitute the greatest threat to the defence system. Although it is still difficult to turn complex flooding processes into manageable mathematical models, the calculations provide the most realistic picture of the probability of flooding based on current understanding. The calculated probability, however, is not yet robust enough for these figures to be considered absolute values. Further research and development of the method could help to make the method more robust in the future. 									The use of new methods for determining the probabilities of flooding and the consequences along the considerable length of the water defences took more time and effort than had been envisaged, not least because the necessary data on the dykes was not always to hand in the right format or at the right time. It is possible to identify where the weakest locations are in the dyke ring and which failure mechanism is responsible. The dyke manager can use this soundly-based information to set priorities for the maintenance of a dyke ring. 									9. Success and Fail factors									A great deal of data was needed to be able to apply the new methods, including information about the sub-soil under the dykes and engineering works. In some cases, this data is surrounded by many uncertainties. An essential element in the probability calculations is that the order of uncertainty is expressly included in the calculation. These calculations offer an opportunity to analyse what failure mechanisms have the most impact on the probability of flooding and where, relatively speaking, the weakest locations are in a dyke ring.									10. Unforeseen outcomes									As a result of the study, the Water Boards carefully check the water defences for signs of piping with each high water and are also prepared if signs of piping are found. From the results of the Floris project it appears that the probability of flooding is greater than the present standards allow for. Because the current standards must be maintained per dyke section, maintenance and investment may not always be carried out where they are most urgently needed or would be most cost-effective. Where there is a high probability of failure due to non-closure of hydraulic structures, this is due to procedures not being properly documented or sufficiently practised. The probability of flooding in such cases can be easily, effectively and cheaply reduced and many Water Boards are now implementing the necessary measures.									11. Prepared by									A. H.

Addressing the challenge of water scarcity and droughts in the European Union 



(Text with EEA relevance)

Access to good quality water in sufficient quantity is fundamental to the daily lives of every human being and to most economic activities. But water scarcity and droughts have now emerged as a major challenge – and climate change is expected to make matters worse. This is a worldwide problem, and the European Union is not spared.

Over the past thirty years, droughts have dramatically increased in number and intensity in the EU. The number of areas and people affected by droughts went up by almost 20% between 1976 and 2006. One of the most widespread droughts occurred in 2003 when over 100 million people and a third of the EU territory were affected. The cost of the damage to the European economy was at least € 8.7 billion. The total cost of droughts over the past thirty years amounts to € 100 billion. The yearly average cost quadrupled over the same period [1].

While "drought" means a temporary decrease in water availability due for instance to rainfall deficiency, "water scarcity" means that water demand exceeds the water resources exploitable under sustainable conditions. At least 11% of the European population and 17% of its territory have been affected by water scarcity to date. Recent trends show a significant extension of water scarcity across Europe.

Water scarcity and droughts are therefore not just a matter for water managers. They have a direct impact on citizens and economic sectors which use and depend on water, such as agriculture, tourism, industry, energy and transport. In particular, hydropower which is a carbon neutral source of energy, heavily depends on water availability. Water scarcity and droughts also have broader impacts on natural resources at large through negative side-effects on biodiversity, water quality, increased risks of forest fires and soil impoverishment.

In a context where changes in climate are foreseen in spite of significant EU mitigation efforts, this trend is expected to continue and even worsen, as underscored in the recently adopted Commission Green Paper on adaptation to climate change. According to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change [2], climate change would bring water scarcity to between 1.1 and 3.2 billion people if temperatures rose by 2 to 3° C. Drought affected areas are likely to increase in extent. In these circumstances, it has become an EU priority to devise effective drought risk management strategies.

On 10 January 2007 the Commission adopted an Energy and Climate package to guide the EU towards a sustainable, competitive and secure energy policy. One of its central themes is to tackle the energy challenge by first making an effort to use energy more efficiently before looking at alternatives. This approach is also valid for water scarcity and droughts. In order to come to grips with water scarcity and droughts, the first priority is to move towards a water-efficient and water-saving economy. Saving water also means saving energy, as extracting, transporting and treating water comes at a high energy cost. In this context, it is essential to improve water demand management.

Addressing the challenge of water scarcity and droughts in the European Union 



(Text with EEA relevance)

Access to good quality water in sufficient quantity is fundamental to the daily lives of every human being and to most economic activities. But water scarcity and droughts have now emerged as a major challenge – and climate change is expected to make matters worse. This is a worldwide problem, and the European Union is not spared.

Over the past thirty years, droughts have dramatically increased in number and intensity in the EU. The number of areas and people affected by droughts went up by almost 20% between 1976 and 2006. One of the most widespread droughts occurred in 2003 when over 100 million people and a third of the EU territory were affected. The cost of the damage to the European economy was at least € 8.7 billion. The total cost of droughts over the past thirty years amounts to € 100 billion. The yearly average cost quadrupled over the same period [1].

While "drought" means a temporary decrease in water availability due for instance to rainfall deficiency, "water scarcity" means that water demand exceeds the water resources exploitable under sustainable conditions. At least 11% of the European population and 17% of its territory have been affected by water scarcity to date. Recent trends show a significant extension of water scarcity across Europe.

Water scarcity and droughts are therefore not just a matter for water managers. They have a direct impact on citizens and economic sectors which use and depend on water, such as agriculture, tourism, industry, energy and transport. In particular, hydropower which is a carbon neutral source of energy, heavily depends on water availability. Water scarcity and droughts also have broader impacts on natural resources at large through negative side-effects on biodiversity, water quality, increased risks of forest fires and soil impoverishment.

In a context where changes in climate are foreseen in spite of significant EU mitigation efforts, this trend is expected to continue and even worsen, as underscored in the recently adopted Commission Green Paper on adaptation to climate change. According to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change [2], climate change would bring water scarcity to between 1.1 and 3.2 billion people if temperatures rose by 2 to 3° C. Drought affected areas are likely to increase in extent. In these circumstances, it has become an EU priority to devise effective drought risk management strategies.

On 10 January 2007 the Commission adopted an Energy and Climate package to guide the EU towards a sustainable, competitive and secure energy policy. One of its central themes is to tackle the energy challenge by first making an effort to use energy more efficiently before looking at alternatives. This approach is also valid for water scarcity and droughts. In order to come to grips with water scarcity and droughts, the first priority is to move towards a water-efficient and water-saving economy. Saving water also means saving energy, as extracting, transporting and treating water comes at a high energy cost. In this context, it is essential to improve water demand management. Just like energy, water is necessary for all human, economic and social activities. A wide range of policy options will therefore need to be considered.

Against the above background, this Communication presents an initial set of policy options at European, national and regional levels to address and mitigate the challenge posed by water scarcity and drought within the Union. The Commission remains fully committed to continuing to address the issue at international level, in particular through the United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification and the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change.

This Communication also responds to the request for action on water scarcity and droughts from the Environment Council in June 2006.

1. Setting the scene

The following challenges need to be addressed:

· Progressing towards full implementation of the Water Framework Directive [3] (hereinafter "WFD"), the EU''s flagship Directive on water policy, is a priority in order to address mismanagement of water resources.

· This issue is often a result of ineffective water pricing policies which generally do not reflect the level of sensitivity of water resources at local level. The ‘user pays’ principle is hardly implemented beyond the sectors of drinking water supply and waste water treatment. Introducing this principle at EU level would put an end to needless losses or waste, ensuring that water remains available for essential uses across Europe, including all parts of transboundary river basins. In other words, it would encourage efficient water use.

(...PICT...)

· Land-use planning is also one of the main drivers of water use. Inadequate water allocation between economic sectors results in imbalances between water needs and existing water resources. A pragmatic shift is required in order to change policy-making patterns and to move forward effective land-use planning at the appropriate levels.

· There is huge potential for water saving across Europe. Europe continues to waste at least 20% [4] of its water due to inefficiency. Water saving must become the priority and all possibilities to improve water efficiency must therefore be explored. Policy making should be based on a clear water hierarchy. Additional water supply infrastructures should be considered as an option when other options have been exhausted, including effective water pricing policy and cost-effective alternatives. Water uses should also be prioritised: it is clear that public water supply should always be the overriding priority to ensure access to adequate water provision.

· Further integration of water-related concerns into water-related sectoral policies is paramount in order to move towards a water-saving culture. Integration achievements at EU, national and regional levels vary widely from one sector to another. In general terms, there is a lack of consistency and, in some cases, even counter-productive effects on water resource protection.

· Finally, in order to be fully effective, policy action on water scarcity and droughts needs to be based on high-quality knowledge and information on the extent of the challenge and projected trends. Existing European and national assessment and monitoring programmes are neither integrated nor complete. Filling knowledge gaps and ensuring data comparability across the EU is therefore a precondition. In this context, research has a significant role to play providing knowledge and support to policy making.

2. Addressing the challenge: policy orientations for future action

It emerges from stakeholder consultations and the proportionate impact assessment carried out for this Communication that an integrated approach based on a combination of options would be the most appropriate approach for addressing water scarcity and droughts, compared to alternatives based on water supply or economic instruments only.

Further economic and legal analyses will be required in the coming months to specify in detail the potential, feasibility and possible timeframe for each of the options considered. Impact assessments should be carried out prior to the introduction of any of the proposed measures.

2.1. Putting the right price tag on water

The issue:

The Commission actively promotes the use of market-based instruments in an environmental context, as underscored by the recently adopted Green Paper on Market-Based Instruments [5]. The existing legal framework in the WFD offers ample room for tackling both water scarcity and droughts through such instruments. In spite of the WFD''s specific requirements (Article 9), economic instruments have not been widely used by Member States thus far. Pricing policies that may appear to be very well designed can prove totally ineffective if most water abstraction is not even metered or registered by the authorities. The WFD (Article 11) requires the implementation of systematic control over water abstraction.

Way forward:

At national level, by 2010:

· Put in place water tariffs based on a consistent economic assessment of water uses and water value, with adequate incentives to use water resources efficiently and an adequate contribution of the different water uses to the recovery of the costs of water services, in compliance with WFD requirements. The ''user pays'' principle needs to become the rule, regardless of where the water comes from. Nevertheless, private households should, irrespective of their available financial resources, have access to adequate water provision.

· Enhance efforts to introduce compulsory metering programmes in all water using sectors.

· More broadly, ensure full implementation of the WFD in order to guarantee or recover sustainable water resources.

Good practice:

In France, irrigators have to be equipped with water meters whenever they go beyond abstraction thresholds. In period 2000-2003, the level of equipment rose from 54% up to 71%, representing 85% of the overall irrigated area.

2.2. Allocating water and water-related funding more efficiently

2.2.1. Improving land-use planning

The issue:

The economic development of some river basins can lead to adverse effects on water resource availability. Particular attention needs to be paid to river basins facing quasi-permanent water stress or scarcity. Existing EU policies have tended to exacerbate the sensitivity of these basins. The widespread development of tourist resorts in sensitive river basins, for instance, has led to significant impacts on local water resources. Farming also has significant impacts notably related to irrigation. Over-abstraction remains an issue also due to incomplete decoupling by some Member States. Successive reforms of the CAP and in particular rural development support have already contributed to improving the situation. Future adjustments of the CAP and the ''Health check'' of 2008 could provide opportunities to examine how to further integrate water quantity issues in the relevant CAP instruments. In this context, it should be for instance considered to what extent the CAP and the "Health check" of 2008 could promote more complete use of full decoupling and increased support for water management within rural development programmes. It will be also important to analyse the impact of the increase in biofuels on water availability. All production including irrigated and biomass production and all economic activities should be adapted to the amount of water available locally. This is a key condition for sustainable land-use planning across Europe.

Way forward:

At European level:

· The increased emphasis on sustainable agriculture over the past decade provides a useful platform for policy debate on further progress in order to increase water management sustainability. This will be of particular importance in the period up to the implementation of the river basin management plans in 2010.

· Further assess the inter-linkages between biofuel development and water availability.

At national level:

· Ensure stringent implementation of the Directive [6] on Strategic Environment Assessment in all economic sectors. Member States still need to strengthen their national procedures and ensure that the conditions attached to the final decisions adequately prevent any environmental impact.

· Encourage Member States to identify river basins which face quasi-permanent or permanent water stress or scarcity.

· For those river basins, set up appropriate regulations to restore a sustainable balance. Voluntary schemes could make a positive contribution and need to be promoted. If results prove insufficient in very sensitive areas, compulsory measures on water saving and water efficiency should be introduced. All measures will ultimately be part of the WFD programmes.

Good practice:

In the framework of the UN Convention to Combat Desertification, Greece has issued a National Action Programme which considers specific measures to address imbalances between demand and supply.

2.2.2. Financing water efficiency

The issue:

The potential for water efficiency is not exploited to the fullest extent in the EU. Even though they are cost-effective, a number of measures are not taken owing to unaffordability.

Addressing the consequences of climate change in particular water scarcity and droughts is one of the priorities of EU regional policy in the period 2007-2013. The new legislative framework provides for investments in infrastructure related to water management (storage, distribution, treatment), clean and water-efficient technologies as well as risk prevention measures.

European funds and State aids offer significant opportunities to meet this challenge, but budgets are undoubtedly insufficient to duly cover all the issues.

National priorities can also be counterproductive in promoting additional water supply infrastructure as the primary option, going against the logic of the water hierarchy and the need to support water-saving and efficiency measures in the first place. It continues to be essential to ensure that the allocation of funding is sufficiently conditional on independent and ex-ante evidence of full utilisation of water savings and efficiency, effective water pricing policy and metering, minimum performance of public water supply networks or recovery of the costs of projects by the water users concerned. National support measures must also fully respect State aid rules where applicable.

Way forward:

At EU level:

· Refine existing Community strategic guidelines for water infrastructures and in the context of the regional and rural development policies, determine whether further progress needs to be made as regards environmental preconditions related to effective water management before support can be given to any additional water supply infrastructure or equipments.

· Explore how sectoral policies could better and further contribute to effective water management, utilising associated funds to foster the delivery of environmental services by water users in an efficient way.

At national level:

· Ensure efficient use of EU and national funds to improve water demand management, in particular through measures of adaptation, sustainable practices, more water savings, monitoring systems and adapted risk management tools.

· Develop fiscal incentives for the promotion of water-efficient devices and practices, in particular in water scarce areas, taking into account the social context and the potential regional differences.

Good practice:

Cyprus has taken conservation measures at household level by encouraging the re-use of "grey water" (i.e. from washing and washing machines) for watering gardens and flushing toilets, reducing per capita water consumption by up to 40%. In 2007, government subsidies cover 75% of the cost of the system.

In Germany, one fifth of the biggest cities have been supporting rainwater harvesting for more than 10 years with the objective of equipping 15% of buildings by 2010.

2.3. Improving drought risk management

2.3.1. Developing drought risk management plans

The issue:

Following the increasing droughts in the past few years, some Member States have moved from crisis management to drought risk management. The associated measures often result in comprehensive drought risk management plans with water stress area mapping, alert levels, warning systems, etc. The WFD has all the necessary flexibility to develop specific drought management plans in relevant river basins.

Way forward:

At European level:

Foster exchanges of information and best practices on drought risk management. Identify methodologies for drought thresholds and drought mapping. By the end of 2008, develop recommendations.

At national level:

· By 2009, set up specific drought management plans to supplement WFD river basin management plans, where needed, in accordance with WFD provisions (Article 13(5)).

Good practices:

Spain and the Netherlands have already implemented national plans to address drought risks.

The European Expert Network set up as part of the Common Implementation Strategy of the WFD is working on the development of drought management plans. A first workshop was held on the initiative of Spain in June 2007.

2.3.2. Developing an observatory and an early warning system on droughts

The issue:

The Commission is currently developing a European Drought Observatory which will enhance the knowledge of the issue. Efficient alert systems are also an essential dimension of risk management. An early warning system will therefore follow suit to improve the drought preparedness of the relevant authorities. This system will integrate relevant data and research results, drought monitoring, detection and forecasting on different spatial scales, from local and regional activities to continental overview at EU level, and will make it possible to evaluate future events.

Way forward:

At European and national levels:

· By 2012, develop prototypes and set up implementing procedures for operational European Drought Observatory and early warning system.

Good practice:

Within the context of the United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification, Slovenia is hosting a Drought Management Centre for South-Eastern Europe which works on drought preparedness, monitoring, forecasting and management.

Within the context of FP5, a European Drought Centre has been proposed. This is a virtual knowledge centre, which promotes collaboration and capacity building between scientists and the user community, and thereby increases preparedness and resilience of society to drought.

2.3.3. Further optimising the use of the EU Solidarity Fund and European Mechanism for Civil Protection

The issue:

Up to now, Member States affected by severe droughts have never applied for assistance under the European Union Solidarity Fund (EUSF). Nor have they asked for civil protection assistance to obtain urgent water supplies.

Way forward:

At EU level:

· Reiterate the Commission''s readiness to fully examine any request for EUSF support communicated by a Member State seriously affected by a drought while ensuring that the request is not the indirect result of inefficient water management and that appropriate drought management plans are in place.

· In the context of the EUSF regulation, examine whether further progress needs to be made as regards the definition of the criteria and eligible operations in order to allow the Solidarity Fund to better respond to drought events.

· The Mechanism for Civil Protection will consider all opportunities to incorporate drought issues in future annual work programmes. One objective will be to identify all possibilities of assistance in cases of severe droughts, having consequences such as forest fires, and to aim at using and complementing the scarce resources available in the best way.

· The Civil Protection Expert Group on Early Warning Systems will be requested to develop an approach to optimise the use of the drought early warning system at European and national levels and to anticipate any civil protection preparatory action.

2.4. Considering additional water supply infrastructures

The issue:

In regions where all prevention measures have been implemented according to the water hierarchy (from water saving to water pricing policy and alternative solutions) and taking due account of the cost-benefit dimension, and where demand still exceeds water availability, additional water supply infrastructure can in some circumstances be identified as a possible other way of mitigating the impacts of severe drought.

There are several possible ways of developing additional water infrastructures, such as storage of surface or ground waters, water transfers, or use of alternative sources.

The constructions of new water supply dams and water transfers are subject to EU legislation. Interruption or transfers of stream flow inevitably change the status of water bodies and as such are subject to specific and strict criteria. In addition, large projects often provoke social and political conflict between donors and receiving basins, which calls their sustainability into question.

Alternative options like desalination or waste water re-use are increasingly considered as potential solutions across Europe. Any definitive Commission position on these options will have to be based on further work on risk and impact assessment, taking into account the specific bio-geographical circumstances of Member States and regions.

Way forward:

At EU level:

· By the end of 2008, prepare a Commission assessment of all alternative options

At national level:

· Ensure that all adverse effects linked to any additional water supply infrastructure like dams or desalination plants - are fully taken into account in the environmental assessment. The changes expected as a possible consequence of climate change and the objectives to be achieved within the Energy Policy for Europe must be fully considered in order to avoid any incompatibility.

Good practice:

Research projects such as MEDINA [7] and MEDESOL [8] (6th Framework Research Programme) are currently underway with a view to minimising the volume of brine or reducing energy consumption in case of desalination.

2.5. Fostering water efficient technologies and practices

The issue:

All economic sectors need to continue to develop water-efficient technologies and practices. Water performance could still be considerably improved across the EU. In some regions, up to 30% of the volume of water consumed in buildings could be saved [9]. In some cities, leakages in public water supply networks can exceed 50%. Similar wastage of water has been recorded in irrigation networks. In addition to improving technologies, the upgrading of water management practices is a necessary instrument in all sectors where huge quantities of water are used (e.g. agriculture, manufacturing or tourism).

Way forward:

At EU level:

· Consider developing standards for water-using devices such as irrigation systems and other farm energy-using equipments.

· Consider developing legislation to cover non-energy-using products including water-using devices (taps, shower heads, toilets).

· Include water efficiency criteria in performance standards for buildings when harmonising Life Cycle Assessments and Environmental Product Declarations.

· Consider developing a new directive similar to the Energy Performance of Building Directive [10] for water performance of buildings. This could cover taps, showers and toilets, rainwater harvesting and reuse of "grey water".

· Consider adopting of a performance indicator on the use of water in the revision of the EMAS Regulation to be presented by the Commission. Working towards the possible certification of all buildings of the European Institutions gradually over the next years.

· Encourage enhanced research on adaptation of economic activities to water scarcity and droughts, water efficiency and decision-making tools.

At national level:

· Encourage the adoption of binding performances for new buildings and for public and private networks, with systems of fines for excessive leakages.

At EU and national levels:

· Develop voluntary agreements with all economic sectors that need water (builders, building managers, manufacturers, tourism professionals, farmers, local authorities) to develop more water-friendly products, buildings, networks and practices.

Good practices:

In Spain, proactive water-saving programmes have been launched in several towns and have produced significant results. In 1997, Zaragoza launched a comprehensive programme based on updated water devices and equipment, introduction of metering and raising public awareness. Its implementation resulted in the saving of 1.2 billion litres of water per year and the lowest water consumption per inhabitant and per day in Spain (96 l/person/day).

2.6. Fostering the emergence of a water-saving culture in Europe

The issue:

Developing a responsible water-saving and efficiency culture requires an active awareness-raising policy in which all actors in the water sector need to be involved. Information, education and training are priority areas for action.

Consumers increasingly demand more information on the way water is used at all stages of the industrial or agri-food process. Labelling is an effective way to provide targeted information to the public on water performance and on sustainable water management practices. The marketing of ever more efficient devices or "water-friendly" products should be encouraged.

In line with Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR), economic operators involved in quality or certification schemes should be encouraged to promote their products on the basis of the demonstrated efficient use of water.

Way forward:

At EU level:

· Explore, together with the European Business Alliance on CSR, the possibility of launching an Alliance initiative on the efficient use of water.

· Encourage the inclusion of rules on water management in existing and future quality and certification schemes.

· Explore the possibility of expanding existing EU labelling schemes whenever appropriate in order to promote water efficient devices and water-friendly products.

At national level:

· Further encourage the development of educational programmes, advisory services, exchanges of best practices and large targeted campaigns of communication focused on water quantity issues.

Good practice:

In summer 2006, France launched a national campaign entitled "Will everyone get enough water?" This campaign based on television and radio spots encouraged individual efforts at water saving. The public considered the messages were convincing. 88% said that they make efforts to save water.

2.7. Improve knowledge and data collection

2.7.1. A water scarcity and drought information system throughout Europe

The issue:

Reliable information on the extent and impacts of water scarcity and droughts is indispensable for decision-making at all levels. Shared definitions are necessary to ensure data consistency at EU level. The recently published Water Information System for Europe (WISE) [11] provides the ideal platform to integrate and disseminate such information.

Way forward:

· Present an annual European assessment, based on agreed indicators and data provided by Member States and stakeholders to the Commission or the European Environment Agency on a yearly basis.

· Fully exploit the Global Monitoring for Environment and Security (GMES) services for the delivery of space-based data and monitoring tools in support to water policies, land use planning and improved irrigation practices.

2.7.2. Research and technological development opportunities

The issue:

Support, coordination and dissemination of research efforts between the EU and national levels will ensure the best match between research needs and what is on offer to society including practitioners and policy makers. LIFE+ and transboundary programmes under the European Neighbourhood and Partnership Instrument (ENPI) on water scarcity and drought management should be coordinated. Synergies have to be sought between policy and research in this respect.

Way forward:

· Disseminate and facilitate the use and exploitation of the results of research on water scarcity and drought issues.

· Explore, enhance and encourage research and technological activities in this area, including networking, under the opportunities that the Seventh Community Research Framework Programme may bring. These research results may start to be operational and integrated to policy by 2009.

3. Conclusions

The challenge of water scarcity and droughts needs to be addressed both as an essential environmental issue and also as a precondition for sustainable economic growth in Europe. As the EU seeks to revitalise and reinvigorate its economy and to continue to lead on tackling climate change, the devising of an effective strategy towards water efficiency can make a substantial contribution.

This Communication identifies a first set of policy options with a view to opening up a wide-ranging debate on how to adapt to water scarcity and droughts, two phenomena that could potentially increase in a context of climate change. The options proposed in the Communication could already start to bear fruit in the short term. The Commission therefore believes that more has to be done to introduce these measures swiftly at EU level. In this sense it is important to consider the role of the state of the art research results can play for policy making. The Commission will review progress towards the set orientations and will report on them to the Council and the European Parliament. The report will be presented in the context of a Stakeholder Forum to be held in 2008.

In the light of the discussions on this Communication in the Council of Ministers - starting with the Informal Environment Council on 1 September 2007- and the European Parliament and of the results of the above-mentioned report, the Commission will consider follow-up initiatives and action within the coming few years.

Overview of the case									The Advanced Seminars of the Azahar Programme focus on three major Mediterranean sub-regions, the Maghreb, the Middle East and south-eastern Europe. The seminars are oriented to technical coastal experts and managers, representatives from the different administrations of the Azahar Mediterranean countries. The attendees must have a major technical degree related to engineering, oceanography or geology, or else they must be co-ordinating coastline management teams incorporating personnel with the aforesaid qualifications. Different topics of ICZM have been covered through technical presentations including theory, Spanish cases studies and practical sessions. Three seminars have been carried out on Tools, Plans &amp; Programmes, and Case Studies.									5. Context and Objectives									a) Context									The Mediterranean is a perfect illustration of the global challenge of sustainable development. It is a complex region that possesses many different ecosystems and landscapes characterised by a very high level of biodiversity. It is the crossroad between three continents, Asia, Africa and Europe with very different cultural backgrounds, forms of governments and levels of development. The human population of the Mediterranean is distributed along the coast and concentrated in coastal cities and this trend is increasing. It is one of the most important tourism destinations worldwide and it has a strategic importance for the transportation of goods and for energy supply. Finally, the development of many different civilizations along its coast has left an important cultural heritage that requires special attention for its conservation. The socio-cultural, economic and territorial disparities, the persistence of conflicts and the increases in pressure on the environment, show that the Mediterranean region is not achieving sustainable development.									There is a need, both at the national level of each state and at the Mediterranean regional level, for a coordinated and integrated effort of the different coastal stakeholders to achieve a sustainable development of the coastal areas, especially concerning tourism development. ICZM is a chance and a challenge for the Mediterranean countries to reach a balanced and sustainable management of the coastal system and its resources.									b) Objectives									The goal of these seminars is to improve the south-eastern Mediterranean coastal management by transferring to their coastal managers some Spanish and European experiences, knowledge, tools, techniques and technologies for the development and implementation of Mediterranean ICZM. Coastal managers were trained in different topics within ICZM, including practical exercises, case studies and field visits. Some case studies at the national, European and international level, were presented. On the European level, the DEDUCE project for the Sustainable Development of European Coastal Zones and the SMAP III Coastal Action Plan for Nador (CAP Nador), among others, were thoroughly explained. The timescale associated with these seminars and the achievement of their goals is 3 weeks, divided in 3 years (2005-07).									6. Implementation of the ICZM Approach (i.e. management, tools, resources)									a) Project Management									These Advanced seminars of the Azahar Programme were promoted and funded by the Spanish Agency for International Development Cooperation (AECID) and organised by the University of Cantabria. 									b) ICZM tools									The category of this ICZM initiative is: training and capacity building. The seminars focus on three major Mediterranean sub-regions; the countries involved in these seminars being the Maghreb, the Middle East and south-eastern Europe, being Morocco, Algeria, Tunisia, Mauritania, Egypt, Palestinian Territories, Jordan, Lebanon, Syria, Bosnia-Herzegovina, Serbia, Montenegro , Albania and Turkey. Coastal managers from all these countries, at the national, regional and local level, attended the seminars. The Mediterranean coastal managers were trained in the following topics and tools: 																																Integrated characterisation of the coastal areas: ecological, physical, socio-economic, legal and administrative aspects.													Tools and technologies for ICZM: indicators, GIS, carrying capacity assessment and numerical modelling of coastal processes.													Techniques for stakeholders stock-taking and public participation processes.													Implementation of coastal plans and programmes													Risk (natural and human) assessment and coastal processes: vulnerability in coastal areas, interaction between ports and coasts, natural and anthropogenic erosion processes, extraction of sand and dredging, destruction of sand-dunes, silting-up of marshes and estuaries, marine pollution and water quality.																															7. Cost and resources									The budget to organise and implement this initiative was: €43,121 (2005), €38,032 (2006) and €40,000 (2007). The programme included the training seminar and its materials, transportation of attendees and speakers from the country of origin, travel insurance, accommodation and maintenance during the entire period of the seminar, transportation during field visits and simultaneous translation of the conferences to both English and French. The manpower used for the organization and implementation of the initiative was 7-10 people for each seminar (3 technical staff, 1 organization staff, 3-6 external speakers). 									8. Effectiveness (i.e. were the foreseen goals/objectives of the work reached?)									The attending coastal managers were trained in the above-mentioned topics. The objective was achieved in the timescale defined.									9. Success and Fail factors									The main factors that were helpful in achieving the objective were the support and availability of funds from AECID, the technical and organization staff and the willingness of the Mediterranean coastal managers to come, learn and share experiences. The main factors beyond the control of the process that could or did negatively affect the achievement of the objectives were that some countries do not have a specific agency dealing with coastal issues so other technical managers attended (water, urban planning, etc.) and the difficult situation that the Mediterranean coastal managers face to get out of their countries to attend the seminars (e.g. Palestinian territories). The course was planned to be a continuous training course (3 weeks divided in 3 years), but some of the attendees had to cancel their attendance due to these problems. 									10. Unforeseen outcomes									Making coastal managers from different neighbouring countries live, think and discuss the topics together, a better understanding of the common problems and the common opportunities that ICZM offers is achieved. The differences between countries and authority levels, as well as those related to gender issues, are smoothed out. Empathy and better understanding is promoted.									11.

Overview of the case									A political decision was made to protect ruins on a cliff-face with a hard sea-wall. It was approximately ten times cheaper than re-locating the ruins elsewhere. A later Multi-Criteria Analysis indicated that this option may not have been the best when other, economic factors (from local tourism) would have been considered.									5. Context and Objectives									a) Context									Trzesacz it is a small village with less then 100 citizens, sitting on the the top of 14 m high soft rock cliff in western Poland on the Baltic Sea. It has a coastline of almost one km length of which the community occupies ca. 400 m. The village is primarily important because of the ruins of its XIII century Gothic church although it is a tourist destination in its own right. The local population of Rewal community, which includes Trzesacz, swells from ca. 3300 to over 26000 in the short summer season. The church had originally been built about very close to the shoreline but progressive coastal erosion has resulted in all but a small fragment of the south wall gradual collapsing. The ruins have more of  a symbolic, educational and tourist value, rather than any aesthetic, historical or religious importance. However, if the ruins were to be totally destroyed as a result of erosion, the general public – much of it outside the region - would have a negative perception of the authorities. 									Therefore, two options were considered: one was to continue to protect the cliff and the other was to move the remaining ruins to a new location. The direct costs of the preservation of the cliff were estimated at €0.6m and the costs of moving the ruins by a specialist company were deemed to lie between €3 - 6m depending on the technique chosen for the removal. The first choice was taken, bases solely on cost, and the cliff was strengthened.									b) Objectives									A Multi-Criteria Analysis (MCA) was conducted to determine if the decision taken to strengthen the cliff was the one which might still have been taken if a more embracing economic assessment had been carried out. This entailed looking at the economic factors inherent in this case and comparing a number of alternative scenarios.									6. Implementation of the ICZM Approach (i.e. management, tools, resources)									a) Management									The Maritime Office is responsible for coastal erosion and the decisions in this case were taken in cooperation with the local authorities and mostly financed by them. It was they who agreed the variant of protecting the cliff by building a permanent seawall.									b) ICZM tools									Prior to the decision to strengthen the sea-wall, between 1984-89, the ruins had been protected by a seawall made from tetrapods and stones. The new defence is now a 90 m long x 9m wide seawall, built of gabions which protect the scarp of the cliff with its foot. The ruins have been anchored into the ground. The scarp has been covered with a material suitable for vegetation. This sea-wall, although likely to protect the ruins is predicted to increase the erosion rate of the coast either side of it.									In order to determine, with hindsight, if this had been the most suitable option, an MCA was conducted. The reasoning behind this was not to prove that any decision taken might have been mistaken (or indeed, correct) and to try and change that decision but to see what the result would be when more economic criteria were taken into account. This would show whether or not such economic aspects have a place in pragmatic coastal management in the future. The essence of a multi-criteria analysis is the application of various evaluation criteria of individual variants whose evaluation units are points, allocated in the least arbitrary way. These points substitute monetary units in the evaluation of the expenditures when the benefits and losses are not directly known. It, therefore, allows benefits and losses which are difficult to measure in strict monetary values to be included in a more objective assessment. In many cases, the number of granted points for a particular parameter will be weighted as some parameters are deemed to be more relevant than others.									In the case of the church ruins in Trzesacz, the criteria were divided into two basic groups: the value of costs of the measure undertaken (expenditures) and the value of the wider benefits and losses e.g real estate/property values, tourism and recreation-related issues. Seven different scenarios were chosen for comparison. These were:Variant 0- do nothing i.e. take no action and let erosion continue naturally. It is recognised that this is not a policy option from either a social or a political perspective.Variant 1- Maintain the cliff i.e. the measure which has been taken and described above.Variant 2 – Relocation of the ruins i.e. dismantle the church ruins and re-assemble them again in a place not too far distant from the original location, but safe from erosion.Variant 3 – Pier/Platform construction i.e. building a pier/platform anchored deep into the ground on which the ruins would be placed in their present condition. They would remain as the cliff continued to erode.Variant 4 – Mark the Position i.e. allow the ruins to collapse but mark the position where the ruins stood with a column, mast, or special construction. Again, as with (1) this is not really a viable option.Variant 5 – Beach Nourishment i.e. intensively and systematically nourish the beach at the foot of the cliff to prevent erosion. This is still an option for the current structure should it fail to work or any adverse side effects require further intervention.Variant 6 - Extend the seawall i.e. to make the current seawall longer to further protect the immediate cliff face from erosion.									The results of the analysis show, not-surprisingly, that the most economically effective would have been to do nothing, allow ersoion to take its course and let the ruins disappear. Given that this was never an option on social or political grounds, it is most interesting that the most cost-effective measure would have been to re-locate the ruins elsewhere. The third ranked option was to allow the cliffs to erode and mark the site of the ruins. Again not a political option. Only then do we come to the option that was actually taken i.e. holding the line. This had about the same score as preserving the ruins on a platform but letting erosion take its course. Beach nourishment was next in the ranking and  the final ranking, a long way behind was the option to extend the seawall.									This analysis would indicate that the executed option may not have been the best solution when the economic factors of the local tourist industry are fed into the equation. Their exposure to risk and potential extra costs as a result of the protective actions taken will negatively burden the overall balance of coastline protection in the area. This is because further measures will still need to be taken in the future as the new seawall has increased erosion either side of it. Although the political decision that was taken might still have been the one chosen had this MCA been conducted earlier, at least more economic arguments would have been considered. Under the circumstances, perhaps a different solution may have been chosen. The study shows that decisions based solely on short-term economics, however well meant, may not lead to the optimal solution.									7. Cost and resources									No costs are available.									8. Effectiveness (i.e. were the foreseen goals/objectives of the work reached?)									The major accomplishment of MCA results is that they allow for a more accurate representation of decisions by accounting for several objectives simultaneously. As with all MCA models, the key question on which the model centres is whose preferences are to be considered. Different stakeholders are likely to assign different priorities to the respective objectives and thus it may be difficult to arrive at a single, best solution. Thus, there is value in constructing options from differing perspectives and comparing the results. Nonetheless, this methodology is proven in reconciling differences between individual and social preferences and in selecting strategic development decisions.									9.

Experiences that can be exchanged									A repeatable methodology has been demonstrated which facilitates the identification of beach and dune areas that are particularly susceptible to the effects of coastal erosion, to determine whether there is erosion or accretion of the soft coast, and to quantify  how much gain or loss (+ve or –ve change) has been occurring. 									4. Overview of the case									Comparisons have been made using archival pan-chromatic and colour aerial photography taken with a separation of 10-20 years between them. Using photogrammetry and GIS, an easily understandable, 3D visualisation of erosion and accretion was produced showing erosion hot-spots and vulnerable, coastal areas.  									5. Context and Objectives									a) Context									One of the potential impacts of climate change, sea level rise and increased storm frequency and intensity, is increasing coastal erosion. Identifying areas of the coast that are the most vulnerable to coastal erosion (both wind and wave dominated), where such changes are occurring,  and quantifying this change is becoming increasingly important, particularly along the soft coastlines. In Scotland,  Scottish Natural Heritage is particularly interested in developing new ways to monitor and map coastal change in order to identify erosion hotspots. Furthermore, they are keen to find innovative ways to visualise the potential impacts of coastal change as the means to communicate information to a wider audience e.g. local communities about the changes occurring at the coast as a way to raise awareness and educate people about the impacts of climate change at the coast.									b) Objectives									The overall goal of the work was to provide a practical means by which it was possible to monitor and map coastal change over time, and to provide a basis for demonstrating the practical role of remote sensing, Geographical Information Systems (GIS), and digital photogrammetry. In addition, the work formed the basis for future monitoring studies using LIDAR data and imagery.									6. Implementation of the ICZM Approach (i.e. management, tools, resources)									a) Management									Aberdeen Institute for Coastal Science and Management (AICSM) at the University of Aberdeen conducted the work on behalf of Scottish Natural Heritage.									b) ICZM tools									Archival pan-chromatic and colour aerial photography was acquired for seven beach areas in the North East and North of Scotland identified by Scottish Natural Heritage (SNH). These areas were deemed to be ones where change was most likely based upon expert knowledge and fieldwork. At least two sets of aerial photography were acquired for each site, with ideally a temporal separation of twenty years between them. In some cases this was not possible and a ten year interval was accepted. 									In order to use photogrammetric techniques it is also necessary to obtain ground control. Each site was visited and a network of ground control points was measured using two Global Positioning Systems, a Fugro Omnistar HP Differential system, and a Trimble 5800 Real Time Kinematic system. This is a time consuming process and one that is further complicated by the relative inaccessibility of some sites. Furthermore, although a straightforward process, the photogrammetric derivation of the topographic contours and Digital Terrain Models (DTMs) relies on the tonal quality of the original aerial photographs, easily identifiable ground control points, and the ease with which such points can be found in coastal areas; areas where stable features such as roads, field boundaries, and buildings are often scarce.									Digital photogrammetric techniques were used to derive DTMs for each date of photography and each site. Specialist photogrammetric software (Erdas Imagine and BAE SocetSet) and hardware (stereoscopic glasses and screen) were used to derive and edit the DTMs. The DTMs were input to the ESRI ArcGIS GIS software for further processing and analysis. 									By subtracting the two multi-temporal DTM grids from each other for each site it was possible to identify where change in the topographic height of the land had changed from one date to the next, and by how much.  It was therefore possible to generate a map of change showing where the beach and dune areas had been eroded (negative or loss of sand), where accretion (positive or gain of sand) had taken place, and areas which had remained stable.  Using ArcGIS, maps showing the coastal change for each beach area were created, and colour coded using a traffic light system (green, amber, red) for ease of communication and interpretation. Green areas showed areas of gain, amber no change, and red erosion. The resulting change maps were then superimposed onto a DTM to provide a 3D visualisation of the beach area, as well as the possibility to generate a fly-through of the areas.These were captured in a video format and used as a visual communication tool for public awareness and education to reveal change at the coast.									7. Cost and resources									The funding for the work was approximately £40,000. 									8. Effectiveness (i.e. were the foreseen goals/objectives of the work reached?)									The development of user-friendly visualisations provides a basis with which to communicate  information  results about what is a relatively complicated and sophisticated process and analytical procedure to a wider audience which is then easier to understand and can be used in the context of raising awareness and education.									9. Success and Fail factors									Some inevitable and recognised limitations to the approach proposed arose because of the different sources of aerial photographs uses, different formats available (paper print, diapositive, digital), different scales flown (although most were around 1:10,000), different quality of the prints (prints vary in their quality and condition, and degradation can occur following scanning of the information content), availability of the camera calibration data, and spatial coverage of the overflights. It must be remembered that many studies based on archival imagery are using photographs that were not flown for the current use.									10. Unforeseen outcomes									None so far. 									11.

Experiences that can be exchanged									A process has been set in place in order to determine how to strengthen a section of dyke that is below the legal safety requirement.									4. Overview of the case									A section of dyke in North Holland no longer meets the legal safety requirements. Four alternative designs have been drawn up and an environmental impact statement (m.e.r.)is being conducted to determine which is the most environmentally favourable. A decision-making process, including strong participation is taking place. The strengthening should be completed by 2015.									5. Context and Objectives									a) Context									The Hondsbossche and Pettemer sea defences are two dyke sections and attached to each other in a longshore direction. They are located in the Province of North Holland along the North Sea and close the gap in the chain of dunes which was a former tidal inlet. They lie in the middle of four Natura 2000 areas and behind them are three polders, with an average surface level of MSL –1 m. and a total area of almost 5 km2, a nature reserve and a residential area with houses located 40 m from the inland toe of the dyke, over a length of 300 m. Both dykes have been assigned the status of a Weak Link (Zwakke Schakel) of which there are ten in the Netherlands. In 2004 they were given a priority status which means that by 2020 a structural solution has to be found so that the defences satisfy Dutch legal safety standards.									The Hondsbossche sea defence has a length of 4.6 km. It has been improved several times (e.g. in 1953, 1976 and 1987). Most recently, in 2005, the dyke has been strengthened by replacing the grass cover on the seaward side with basalton. The different elevations of the stones produce extra roughness and, hence, decreasing wave-run and overtopping. This was meant as temporary measure so that safety standards are met for the time being. Additional measures are being developed to assure long term safety. The Pettemer sea defence has a length of 1,5 km and has, similarly, been temporarily strengthened, this time with a vertical, sheet metal wall and a raising of the crest height by 0.7m. A series of short groynes are located along both dykes. They are spaced at some 100 m distance and are elevated till around MHW (Mean High Water). There are hardly any beaches in between the groyne cells. 									The volume of wave overtopping is expected to increase in the future as a consequence of relative sea level rise and, therefore, a process has been developed for deciding on a more sustainable long term safety.									b) Objectives									The water board (Hoogheemraadschap Hollands Noorderkwartier) and regional provincial government are working on a plan that will see the sea defences strengthened to withstand a storm event of  1:10.000 for the next 50 years. The aim of the project is to find a balance between dyke fortification measures, spatial quality, and social acceptance. 									6. Implementation of the ICZM Approach (i.e. management, tools, resources)									a) Management									The coastal defences are managed by the principal Water board (Hollands Noorderkwartier). The Province has a controlling function and oversees the work of the water board. The central Government is responsible for the final decision of the defence measures. To maintain the basic coast line, the Central Government is responsible for sand strengthened measurements for the whole Dutch coast.									b) ICZM tools									Once these sea defences, together with a second (the “Duinen Kop van Noord-Holland”), had been recognised as being a weak link, the Province of North Holland initiated, in 1999, a multi-disciplinary project referred to as Kustvisie 2050 (‘Perception of the Coast in 2050’). A report in 2005 presented different safety scenarios which would also improve the spatial quality of the coastal zone. In 2006, the Province made an initial choice for an overtopping dyke i.e. a dyke which waves can overtop to a maximum of 10 l/m/s in a heavy storm. This would involve strengthening the crest and inner slope of the dyke. That same year, it was recognised that the effects of climate change had been under-estimated and that this choice would not bring the desired safety and would need to be revised. As a result, in 2007 a new decision was taken to look at four different options. An Environmental Impact Statement procedure was also set up to look at the effects of the alternatives and the costs. 									There are four options under consideration, three primarily strengthen on the landward side and one primarily on the seaward side. They are:-																																traditional crest heightening of  5-7m. This would entail the slope behind the dyke to be lengthened by 42m. with a stability berm of 30m. This would cause some cultural-historic and significant nature losses but the overall landscape would be unchanged. Access for the public and cyclists would be improved with nature areas developed in the polders.													limited crest heightening (2m.) with a widening of the seaward slope and a 12m. widening landwards with a 30m wide berm. Recreation facilities would be realised similar to those in the traditional crest heightening study. This alternative still has to be designed and tested.													coarsening the outer slope. Large rock blocks laid on the seaward slope would give a rough appearance and  would be done in combination with a crown wall on the top of the dyke and the inner slope made erosion proof. A stability berm would be laid on the inner slope which would allow over-topped water during a storm to be caught in a gully which would be laid out as an attractive recreation area. In one place (Petten), a steel dam wall will be needed. The crown of the dyke would also be used for a bicycle path. This would be the cheapest option but maintenance costs may be higher													construction of an extended and higher foreland. This will mean the addition of sand on the seaward side of the dyke 300m out to sea which would be used for beach recreation at Camperduin and Petten aan Zee. In between the recreational areas natural areas will be developed. The inner slope of the dyke would be made erosion-proof, again with a protecting berm. In this area, a visitor’s centre would be built.  Some nature areas may be lost although other areas and foraging areas for birds may be designated although no decision on this has yet been made. Sand would need to be suppleted every five years although it would displace along the coastline. This will also have a positive effect on the coast north of the dyke. In the future it can work as a ‘sand motor’. Projects to strengthen the dyke in the future (after 50 yrs.) will be easier and can be implemented faster than the more conservative ways of strengthening dykes.																															The planning is such that in 2010, the EIA (m.e.r.) would be ready and must give the most environmentally favourable alternative. Following completion, the Province and Water board as well as two municipal councils have accepted the alternative to extend seawards with an extended and higher foreland. This option will now be further worked out into a coastal defence plan in case the option is approved as the preferred alternative (“voorkeursalternatief” VKA). The State Secretary for the Ministry of Traffic and Waterways will also need to approve the choice for which a budget will have to be in place. This final decision is expected in 2010 with work starting in 2012 to be completed by 2015. The whole process is on target and this has been largely helped by an intensive interaction between stakeholders to ensure broad support for the final results. 									7. Cost and resources									Costs are still confidential and are still being calculated to see how much the costs can be reduced. 									8. Effectiveness (i.e. were the foreseen goals/objectives of the work reached?)									 All legal requirements for safety will be fulfilled.									9. Success and Fail factors									Communication with the local community and relevant stakeholders from the outset was deemed to be significant to the success of the work so far. The two partners organized various information evenings and gatherings for the residents about the solutions under discussion and the scheduling of the various activities involved. A website has been set up and a special periodical newsletter and articles in local media produced. 									10. Unforeseen outcomes									None to date.									11. Prepared by									A. H.

Overview of the case									A communication strategy was developed to inform inhabitants of flood-prone areas of the North Sea coast about the risks of flooding, to raise awareness of the public and decision-makers. The effect of the information booklet was evaluated. 									5. Context and Objectives									a) Context									Almost a quarter of Schleswig-Holstein is flood-prone: at the North Sea and Elbe estuary which is less than 5 metres above sea level, and at the Baltic Sea coast less than 3 metres. The test areas for this study were the North Sea island Pellworm, the island Nordstrand with a connection to the mainland, the Elbe estuary city Glückstadt, and the city Eckernförde at a Baltic Sea bay where only part of the city area is flood-prone. 									People tend to become indifferent to risks when they have chosen to take the risk to live in a flood-prone area. An earlier study about risk perception in St. Peter-Ording had revealed an information deficit, a lack of preparedness, and the wish of people to participate in coastal defence planning and action. Only a well informed society is convinced to take protective measures and to participate in decision-making processes concerning coastal protection. Acceptance of protective measures rises with the grade of information about risks in the population. Information material and exhibitions on storm floods and storm flood protection exist.									b) Objectives									The aims were to develop a communication strategy for information about storm flood risks in Schleswig-Holstein that addresses the information needs and wishes of people. Awareness was to be raised for coastal and catastrophic protection to lower the risks for residents in flood-prone areas. 									6. Implementation of the ICZM Approach (i.e. management, tools, resources)									a) Project Management									The case study was co-ordinated and co-financed by the Ministry of the Interior of Schleswig-Holstein / Emergency Planning &amp; Disaster Management Division, and the Schleswig-Holstein State Ministry for Agriculture, Environment and Rural Areas / Coastal Defence Division. 									b) ICZM tools									An information booklet on storm flood risks and protection measures was developed based on recommendations from the analysis. An impact study evaluated the public perception of the booklet, of storm flood risks and protective measures, about climate change impact and participatory action in two separate questionnaires (sent to the same households 8 weeks apart). Based on all the results and findings a communication strategy was developed and a travelling exhibition produced including recommendations from mixed target groups. 									Existing communication strategies, material, and exhibitions in partner countries and Germany were researched and literature on the topic was analysed. Recommendations for risk communication are to focus communication on personal affectedness and on the effectiveness of preventive measures that people can take themselves. People tend to become indifferent to risks when they have chosen to take the risk to live in a flood-prone area. Current risks should therefore be pronounced to re-sensitize people. Risks should be described clearly and manageable, not stressing dangers more than necessary (which could result in a feeling of helplessness). Photos and illustrations provide intuitive access to scientific contents and the description of measures taken by authorities. Sources for further and more detailed information should be given, contact persons named. The quality of the information and the sources stress the trustworthiness of the information given. 									The general public in selected communities at North and Baltic Sea was asked to evaluate the booklet and state their knowledge about coastal protection about their own preventive action and participation in decision-making about storm flood protection. About 70% thought the booklet useful. People at the North Sea coast had a higher risk awareness than at the Baltic Sea coast. About 80% of the respondents of the questionnaires wished for regular communication on the topic of coastal protection at least once per year, and 70% consider radio and television as most important communication channels but also official publications and newspaper and magazine reports are highly approved. Only about 36% estimate the internet as a very important source of information. Almost all people are convinced that climate change is happening, and more than 80% agree that it will influence future storm floods. About 23% would participate in coastal defence, 80% have not been taking an active part at the time of the study.									Recommendations for a communication strategy are: combine communication media to target the different awareness groups. People with risk awareness are actively looking for information while those unaware of risks have to be sensitized for the topic. New forms of information distribution should be used additional to traditional information spreading (calendars, postcards, theatre performances, SMS messages, etc.). Regular information should be produced for television and radio. Official publications, flyers, information events, newspaper articles should be produced to mediate information about regional implications and personal protective measures. Information about local implications of climate change is needed. Information material should follow a uniform layout. Possibilities for public participation need to be increased. When a communication strategy has been developed it needs to be communicated to all responsible authorities and offices that release information material on the topic and the responsible persons have to be trained. 									The exhibition was produced in steps and following the recommendations of the impact assessment: literature research and analysis, analysis of strengths and weaknesses of best examples, concept development in workshops discussing content, layout, and logistics, and production of the actual exhibition. Two random groups (picked from the street at separate dates) were asked to study an existing exhibition, to evaluate it and make recommendations on how to improve the attractiveness and raise the amount of easily-understandable content. One group was presented with additional (new) posters and asked to comment on them as well. Recommendations were developed from the different analyses: reduce text to most important information, explain technical terms separately, use coloured graphs and illustrations with clear relationship to the text, practical advice, further regional information sources, clearly identify the information pavilion, additional advertisements. Storm floods and risks, coastal and disaster protection, climate change and rising sea level were the three topics for the new exhibition. Provocative questions and interactive media urge the exhibition visitor to draw the connection between storm flood risks and their own life and surroundings, thus creating interest. 									7. Cost and resources									The Schleswig-Holstein case study cost €273,000 of which 50% was financed by ERDF funds.									8. Effectiveness (i.e. were the foreseen goals/objectives of the work reached?)									A communication strategy was developed based on literature and best practice analyses and user feedback. Accordingly a booklet was produced. It met the needs of the people and stimulated them to think about flood risks and prevention. An exhibition was developed based on the feedback from potential users and on the analyses of the literature and best practice examples. 									9. Success and Fail factors									The first questionnaire was sent back by 16.7% of the people, the second by only 13.71%, probably due to the repetition – one can expect a return rate of 15-20%. Additional knowledge was gained about the risk perception of people, their wishes for information, and the preferred modes of information dissemination via television and radio. Some wishes were to be regularly informed, to gain specific information on regional protection measures, and how to behave in case of a catastrophe. Up to 40% of the people who had received the booklet were stimulated to think about the topic flood risk and prevention. Feedback from potential users added to the literature and best practice analyses on how to convey information to the target groups, and how to design the information material. The Baltic Sea coast population was identified to have a considerably lower risk perception. Thus, the communication strategy for the Baltic Sea coast has to concentrate on awareness-raising. More options for participation have been identified as a need. 									10. Unforeseen outcomes									None.									11. Prepared by									Priv.-Doz. Dr. habil.

This management relies heavily on an understanding of coastal processes at work and the effects that these processes have on shoreline evolution for which accurate data is required.									4. Overview of the case									Shoreline management methods have changed significantly during the past 10 years with a departure from hard engineering. This presents a complex risk management scenario that requires high quality information to support effective management. 									5. Context and Objectives									a) Context									Beach monitoring projects within the UK have often been confined to short stretches of coastline, usually established in conjunction with individual beach re-charge schemes. Effective planning and implementation of shoreline management requires high quality, long-term, time-series data sets, at appropriate spatial and temporal resolution, to predict long-term coastal evolution and to determine design conditions for coastal protection and flood defence projects. 									The exposed coastline of southeast England is characterised by soft sedimentary geology that is vulnerable to erosion, and extensive areas of low-lying land and high coastal urbanisation that are vulnerable to flooding. Approximately 10% of the population and billions of pounds of infrastructure are at risk from flooding in southeast England, within a vulnerable area that exceeds 480km2. The Bournemouth coast lies on the South Coast of the UK between Poole in the west and Christchurch in the east. It has been designated as a World Heritage Site and is now known as the Jurassic Coast. Bournemouth Borough Council currently operates coastal protection policies established after many years of practical experience and maintenance. A vital part of any coastal defence scheme is accurate monitoring data that allows for an understanding of current and past patterns in coastal evolution. This information is essential to inform shoreline management planning and design conditions for operational flood and coastal defence strategies. 									b) Objectives									The primary aim is to provide up-to-date, relevant information in a format that can be understood by coastal managers to implement shoreline management.									6. Implementation of the ICZM Approach (i.e. management, tools, resources)									a) Management									Bournemouth Borough Council is responsible overall for the management of the Bournemouth Coast. In 2002, the Regional Strategic Coastal Monitoring Programme (RSCMP) was assigned the task for the planning and implementation of the monitoring programme. The RSCMP aims at providing a more holistic approach to coastal monitoring by creating a region wide policy and a standardised methodology that each local authority or the lead authority should follow.									b) ICZM tools									The Bournemouth coastline has experienced a progression of protection measures to control erosion and safeguard the sandy beaches that are so vital to its tourist economy. A shift from a ‘hard’ engineering approach to a ‘soft’ engineering approach occured in the 1970s and between 1970-2000 almost 2 million m3 of sand has been used to replenish the beaches at Bournemouth and Poole. Sand was pumped from sites over 400m offshore from the position of mean low water. The coincidental dredging of the Poole Harbour entrance at the same time as the need for beach replenishment material at Bournemouth and Poole substantially reduced the costs as the dredged material was used. The beach was intensively monitored thereafter by beach profiling, which extended up to 450m offshore. Surveys were undertaken at frequent intervals along 38 survey lines. 				Additional monitoring was carried out with regards to particle size testing, aerial survey, real-time tide and wave data and particle size testing of the beach material, twice annually to match the topographic surveys undertaken at Bournemouth between 1974 and 2002. Annual aerial surveys from 1987 have also formed part of the monitoring of coastal evolution at Bournemouth. These aerial surveys are now undertaken as part of the RSCMP and also include photogrammetric profiling along the South-East coast. Real-time tide data and wave data are collected by both the tide gauge on Bournemouth Pier and the directional wave rider buoy located at Boscombe. Tidal data at Bournemouth has been recorded since 1974 although the original gauge fell into disrepair in about 1990 and was replaced by the present Proudman Oceanographic Laboratory (POL) gauge in 1995. Daily weather records have been kept by hand from 1974 until 1999, when electronic stations were installed. Finally, the littoral drift direction at each groyne in Poole Bay has been recorded from 1993 to date in order to try and understand some of the complex responses of sediment transport in the area. Data collection from topographic surveys is collected using Global Positioning Systems. Kinematic GPS provides the opportunity to capture data with a vertical accuracy of approximately +/-2-3cm and horizontal positioning at approximately double the accuracy making it ideal for beach surveys. A minimum of two GPS receivers linked by a radio are used: one receiver acts as a base station, providing corrections, the other is a mobile station used for collection of data. Subsequent surveys are determined by spatial and temporal factors. The profile interval varies from 100m-500m depending on the risk-based analysis of the area. Data is downloaded and stored in a software programme known as SANDS (Shoreline and Near shore Data System). This programme provides a powerful facility through which input data can be analysed to establish links between forcing and response. It also allows weather and shore condition data to be entered, stored, inspected and compared. By analysing both climatic and beach profile data, trends in coastal response can be detected. A daily diary is kept online on the website: 																www.poolebay.net																			7. Cost and resources									Capital project investment on defences within the region exceeds an average of £30 million per year and annual maintenance costs exceed £4.3m/yr.									8. Effectiveness (i.e. were the foreseen goals/objectives of the work reached?)									Predictions of the state of the future coastline as a reaction to the changes in climate have lead to revisions in the future coastal protection policies necessary to protect the Bournemouth coastline. In optimising the most economic solutions for the future protection of the coastline, alternative defences have been examined and costed, together with an assessment of the level of benefits if such defences were to be implemented. With regards to the specific replenishment schemes at Bournemouth, these have been extremely successful, so much so that residents and tourists now take Bournemouth’s excellent sandy beaches for granted. Annual damages averted by maintaining present levels of coastal protection and sea defence are estimated at £203m/yr, a “profit” of nearly £190 m/yr. These results have also collectively indicated that a further 3 million m3 of sand will be required over the next 50 years in order to maintain protective beach levels and widths, thus aiding long-term financial and management planning.									9. Success and Fail factors									The advantage of beach replenishment is that it can be adjusted to cope with unforeseen situations provided that adequate monitoring is undertaken The monitoring data collected since 1974 in Bournemouth has provided an invaluable data source for coastal scientists and engineers alike.The availability of such a long-term monitoring record for Bournemouth both prior to the RSCMP and now within this programme is very rare and must be considered a valuable asset. The use of dredgings from Poole harbour also kept the costs down.									Not all future replenishments will coincide with the dredging of Poole Harbour, so an alternative replenishment source must be found. If the cost of, and demand for, beach fill increases in the future, emphasis will move towards more efficient conservation or other sediments, with beach monitoring as a critical component of this strategy.									10. Unforeseen outcomes									Long-term local coastal monitoring programmes as operated by Bournemouth Borough Council, have demonstrated considerable cost-savings, allowing greater confidence in efficient design of coastal works. The need for future replenishment schemes can now be predicted using the long-term monitoring data that is available, changing the management philosophy from a reactive to a pro-active one									11.

Context and Objectives									a) Context									There was a gap on field data in Cyprus on what are the civic attitudes towards sustainability and sustainable development, ICZM and climate changes. The survey aimed to fill this gap. It was the first time that a survey on these issues was carried out in an island-wide scale in Cyprus, i.e including Greek and Turkish Cypriots. 									b) Objectives									The objective of the survey was to serve as a gap analysis and as an assessment study for recording the state of social perception and civic attitudes towards ICZM and climate changes, as well as to provide decision and policy makers with real data.									6. Implementation of the ICZM Approach (i.e. management, tools, resources)									a) Management									Two Cypriot NGOs, AKTI Project and Research Centre and the Cyprus Environmental Stakeholders Forum (CESF) in co-operation with the United Nations Development Programme -Action for Cooperation and Trust carried out the opinion research survey. The telephone interviews were conducted by RAI Consultants Public Ltd.									b) ICZM tools									The survey employed a quantitative methodology, consisted of telephone interviews and face-to-face interviews with a representative sample of members of the Greek and Turkish Cypriot communities. The sample was distributed proportionately throughout the urban and rural areas of the island. A total sample of 661 telephone interviews were carried out - with 412 Greek Cypriots and 248 Turkish Cypriots.									The survey was structured in 4 thematic groups and included a total of 18 questions:																																Integrated Coastal Zone Management, which included questions on coastal development, water management, tourism, energy and coastal erosion													Climatic change, with questions aiming mainly to record public awareness on the issue													Stakeholder involvement in decision-making processes concerning development, with questions aiming mainly to record public opinion on issues related to transparency of public administration and the will of people to participate in the decision-making process.													Bi-communal co-operation on issues related to the environment, including questions aiming to record public opinion of Greek and Turkish Cypriots in accepting environmental issues as issues with bi-communal character													The results are interesting. Some examples:													66% claimed that they had not heard of the term “sustainable development. Analysis of the answers to the question of whether they had ever heard of this term by ethnic group shows an uneven distribution of awareness, with twice as many Greek Cypriots saying that they had heard of it compared to Turkish Cypriots.													The coastline, with 50% mentions as an aspect facing problems and 4% mentions as an aspect needing greatest attention does not seem to occupy a relatively significant place in the list of environmental concerns of the respondents.													It is notable that there was a higher tendency by respondents from the older age groups of both communities compared to the younger age groups to agree with the statement “I do not like breakwaters, I prefer the beach to be left in its natural formation even if it is eroded”.													The majority of the respondents (68%) thought that Cyprus was affected by climate change very much. Analysis by ethnic group indicates that Greek Cypriots are much more likely than Turkish Cypriots to believe that climate change is influencing Cyprus.													The majority of the respondents from both communities did not think that as citizens they were consulted in the decision-making process on environmental issues.																															7. Cost and resources									The cost (ca. €10000) to run the survey was covered by UNDP-ACT. The setting up of the questionnaire and the evaluation of the results was done voluntarily by experts. 									8. Effectiveness (i.e. were the foreseen goals/objectives of the work reached?)									It was the first time that a survey on these issues covered the entire island, i.e. record the perception of both Greek and Turkish Cypriots. The survey is a base-line study which is repeatable in the future and can serve as a monitoring tool for the evolution of social perception on ICZM, climatic changes and participation in Cyprus. The report was not greatly published mainly due to lack of funding and this was an important draw-back for its effectiveness. Until now, mainly NGOs have used the results to plan their awareness-raising campaigns.									9. Success and Fail factors									Limited funding was an obstacle for the explicit and analytical evaluation of the results, the publicity/ dissemination and the contacts with decision makers. However, a qualitative reading of the results can enlighten several aspects of social perception on aspects such as awareness, participation and public administration.									10. Unforeseen outcomes									As it becomes clear from the answers, both Greek and Turkish Cypriots believe that environment is a bi-communal issue and would accept bi-communal co-operation on relevant issues. This is an important outcome that can support the dialogue among the two communities and the effort to find a solution to the political problem. The two communities of the island have been in isolation from each other since 1974. Efforts for an effective rapprochement started in an organised form only since 2003. The survey supports the opinion that environment can serve as a conflict resolution tool. 									11. Prepared by									 Xenia I.

Experiences that can be exchanged									The design of a mud-flat &amp; salt marsh area by inducing a controlled, reduced tide resulting in a flood-water storage area. Lippenbroek is serving as a pilot area (8 ha.) for a much larger (580 ha) flood control area, further upstream at Kruibeke. This way of controlling flood-water is so new that it could not be applied on a large scale without such testing. The method is suitable for freshwater, tidal areas of highly developed estuaries liable to flood. It is useful for habitat compensation, especially where land is scarce, but it is more expensive than the more natural ways of opening dykes.									4. Overview of the case									Mud flats and marsh land have been created by the innovative use of a controlled, reduced tide scheme which is used to produce a flood water storage area. It was developed to help protect the hinterland from flooding.									5. Context and Objectives									a) Context									The Lippensbroek area lies along the river Scheldt in Hamme (Belgium). The area is flat with a small depression in the centre. Several dykes surrounded the area before the works started: a north-eastern river dyke, a north western dyke and a southern dyke. The Lippenbroek Plan is part of the larger, national Sigmaplan designed to protect the Scheldt basin against storm surges from the North Sea. The area that can be flooded when Scheldt water rises will be a mud-flat/salt marsh. This will be created by means of a controlled, reduced tide in the Lippenbroek area. Without the construction of the flood control area, the Lippenbroek area would have remained agricultural land without any additional value to nature.									b) Objectives									The main objective was to serve as a pilot project for the realisation of the northern part of the flood control area in Kruibeke-Bazel-Rupelmonde; the area itself at Lippenbroek has no, or negligible, influence on the reduction of inundations in the Scheldt estuary because of its small area. However, it was designed as an area that will be used as a reduced tidal area, to create a mudflat/salt marshland ecosystem. It will also act as a recreational area as there is easy access on top of the dyke surrounding the reduced tidal area. It is seen as an alternative to traditional heightening of the dyke. 									6. Implementation of the ICZM Approach (i.e. management, tools, resources)									a) Management									The construction of Hamme Lippenbroek was a joint venture of the Seascheldt Department of Waterways and Sea Channel NV (Waterwegen en Zeekanaal NV) and the Agency for Nature and Forest (Agentschap voor Natuur en Bos). The management of the future flood area will be in hands of several actors concerned. All monitoring and management aspects concerning flood prevention security will be in hands of the initiator of the project, W&amp;Z It concerns the management of the dykes, dyke trenches, in and outlet sluices. The monitoring programme metering all the parameters influencing the nature development is run by the University of Antwerp.									b) ICZM Tools									Before a reduced tidal area could be allowed, the dykes surrounding the area were raised and broadened. One uniform profile was obtained. The building of an inlet sluice (12.75m long with three culverts) was finalized in the summer of 2005. This was completed behind a sheet pile wall securing the construction site from the river Scheldt. An artificial creek directs the inflowing water. The outlet sluice, situated 10m apart from the inlet sluice, had been built in the late eighties. It consists of a square shaft (2m x 2m) with a length of 40m. It has an opening on the riverside and is closed by a one-way valve. In the middle of the shaft, the sluice can be closed by a spindle slide. Over a length of approx. 80 m the river dyke has been lowered to create an overflow dyke. This work was done after the completion of the surrounding dykes and the inlet sluice. The construction of the flood control area behind the river dyke did not include any safety risk. Accessibility is good: an asphalt maintenance road runs across the Scheldt river dyke. The other dykes are also accessible along the crest maintenance roads.									This means that, in case of a storm surge, the storm tide of the Sea-Scheldt is truncated and flows over the overflow dyke into the polder area in a controlled manner. A high ring dyke around the flood control area ensures that the Scheldt water remains in the inundation area. At low tide, the area is emptied as the water flows back to the river through outlet locks. Because of this truncation, the water level in the Sea-Scheldt and the tributaries upstream is less high and the villages are better protected.The sluices are set in such a way that the area within the dyke boundaries follows a natural rhythm of low and high tide. At low water, there is no water flowing in. Twice a day, at high tide, the flood control area is inundated. The higher the tide, the more water will flow through the sluice. Spring tide is when the water is at its highest, at slack water there is little water entering. Each time the water level of the Scheldt drops, the water flows out via the discharging sluice. As a result, the polder is alternately inundated and drained.									7. Cost and resources									No costs are available.									8. Effectiveness (i.e. were the foreseen goals/objectives of the work reached?)									The system has been working since March 2006 with water entering, and leaving, the area daily.The area is now filled with reed, willow, creeks and typical wetland plants. It has become a popular feeding and nesting place for birds and fish now spawn in the Lippenbroek water. The impact on the water quality is even more spectacular. The incoming water of the Scheldt often has extremely low oxygen levels. After the inlet, the level increases by at least 60%. In the time between high and low tide, not only the oxygen level continues to rise but the sand particles sink to the bottom to give clear, still water. The mud flats and marshes also heighten the amount of silica in the water, thus preventing overgrowth of algae.									Monitoring indicates that nearly all fish species observed in the estuary are also observed in the flooded area, frequently in high numbers. Interestingly, the fish seem to be entering through the oxygen-rich waters of the outlet sluice i.e. swimming against the prevailing water flow.									9. Success and Fail factors									The public participation and communication started too late in the process. By engaging stakeholders only in a later phase, a part of their trust was already lost. The problem was solved by appointing a fixed spokesperson (the project engineer) and building an information centre where people could meet up on-site to discuss the matters at hand. Through time and discussion, the trust was rebuilt. Giving stakeholders the opportunity to think and decide along constituted a major step forward in mutual relations. A flood protection zone near houses always causes fear. It is important to provide enough information and a single contact person that can reassure the public involved. The results of a social cost-benefit analysis also helped public-sector bodies in taking the relevant decisions. 									10. Unforeseen outcomes									Sensitivity to vandalism has proven to be a problem to the site and the monitoring programme in particular since the area is easily accessible and opponents of the scheme remain long after completion of the project.									One area of concern for the longer term is the rather high sedimentation rate in the flooded polder. Fresh sediment is required in tidal marshes to advance typical marsh vegetation and fauna. However, excessive sedimentation is to be avoided in a semi-enclosed system as it will lead to decreased water storage capacity.									11.

Overview of the case									Hard constructions for the protection of a highly dynamic coast have not been sufficient to prevent coastal erosion. Sand nourishment in combination with marram grass planting in the dunes and maintenance of coastal forests behind the dunes was found to be an efficient way to protect the coast from further decline. Geo-textiles are used to increase protection at locations where dune ridges are narrow. Sand nourishments have to be repeated depending on occurring erosion and storm surges, on average about every 6 years. 									5. Context and Objectives									a) Context									Rostock is the largest city (about 248,000 inhabitants) on the Baltic coast of the state Mecklenburg-Vorpommern in the north east of Germany and is one of the major seaports of Germany. It is located at the mouth of the river Warnow. Industry, transport, and energy are important sectors in the area due to the port. Fisheries is another relevant economy. Tourism and recreation are of economic importance as well. East of Rostock, the National Park “Vorpommersche Boddenlandschaft” dominates the coast. Many other natural areas of the coast could be conserved. Rostock is an urban area with many values. Flood-prone areas are not  densely populated but encompass great economic values due to the harbour, therefore the area is ranked as a moderate risk e.g.  the damage potential to Warnemünde is about €200 million. Nature conservation is not threatened by erosion.									The average erosion at recession sites of the coast of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern is about 34 m/ 100 years. Erosion (249 km) and deposition (26 km) processes characterise most of the southern Baltic Sea coast of Germany (the total outer coast of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern is about 377 km). West of Rostock a moraine cliff coast dominates while the Rostock-Warnemünde beach is a flat sand beach with dunes. The Warnemünde groynes were built from 1995 to 2000, those at the Markgrafenheide coast further east are mainly from 2005. Sediment transport is mainly wind and wave induced from west to east. Seiches (wind tides) and storm surges can influence water levels by up to 3 metres, normal tides play no big role in the Baltic Sea. Before the shore-line was protected, strong storm surges could cause coastline recessions of about 10 metres. The highest water levels measured during storm surges were between 2,71 m and 2.83 m above mean sea level. In 1874 a storm surge caused a dune break at a length of 1,400 m. 									b) Objectives									Affordable and efficient long-term protection of the flat sandy coast of Rostock from the loss of values considering the different interests is the aim of the coastal protection measures. Climate change effects are taken into account. 									6. Implementation of the ICZM Approach (i.e. management, tools, resources)									a) Management									Sand nourishment and other coastal protection measures are executed by the regional Offices for Environment and Nature (StAUN) in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern. Additionally, the Division Coast of the State Office for Environment and Nature Rostock is responsible for planning, evaluation, and assessment of all coastal protection measures in the state Mecklenburg-Vorpommern. The state authority for coastal protection is the Ministry for Agriculture, Environment, and Consumer Protection Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, department 7 – Water and soil. The assessment of environmental impact and other spatial planning approval and assessment lies with the State Office for Environment, Nature Protection, and Geology. 									b) ICZM tools									The description of the risk situation and the analysis of the efficiency of different coastal protection measures can be used as a decision-making tool for other city beach communities and planners. The assessment study was based on an indicator list. For the development of policy recommendations a pressure-state-impact-response (PSIR) approach has been adopted. The different measures analysed were a seawall (built in 1914, Warnemünde West), revetment (constructed of different materials at Markgrafenheide from 1963-68), groynes (at Warnemünde built from 1995-2000, at Markgrafenheide mainly built or reconstructed in 2005), and sand nourishment. Sand nourishment was started in the early 1970s. The status of the socio-economic situation and the different interests were taken into consideration. Regional neighbouring interests were not affected. Sand nourishment combined with the described biological measures turned out to be an appropriate solution from a technical, economic, and environmental point of view. It does protect the coast line from decline, though it has to be repeated as soon as the artificial sand stocks are depleted. 									At Warnemünde, since 1990, sand from the accumulation zone west of the harbour entrance is used to feed the dunes (1996 1,750 m3, 2000 1,785 m3 + 2,861 m3 , 2006 34,000 m3). East of the harbour entrance, at Hohe Düne, sand from land and sea are used for dune and beach nourishment (1999 12,622 m3, 2004 60,445 m3). At Markgrafenheide beach nourishments are done with sand from the sea floor (1996 140,350 m3, 2003 660,000 m3). Sand from the accumulation zone is moved with shovel excavators. The sand for beach nourishments is excavated with an automated suction dredge device from a depth of 10-15 metres. The sand needs to be of mixed grain size not containing mud or boulder clay, and without dangerous remains of ammunition or toxic substances. Therefore, deposits for such sediments are explored and reserved for dune nourishments. Environmental, morphological, hydrological, and geo-chemical effects of the excavations are monitored. In Warnemünde, in 2005, geo-textile containers were used to line the landward dunes'' bases as a last protection line in case of severe dune erosion. This is a new and additional measure for areas with narrow dune ridges.  									7. Cost and resources									Each year about 800,000 m3 of sand are excavated in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern to protect the coast from erosion; the measures cost about €5 million per year. Sand from the sea floor is cheaper than sand from the accumulation zone because larger masses can be handled in less time. The groyne system of Warnemünde (17 groynes of about 500 poles) cost about €2.1 million, dune feed ups 1992, 2000, and 2006 of about 92,000 m3 sand from the accumulation zone cost about €370,000, the geo-textile protection was constructed 2005-2006 (2 sites with a total length of 600 m and 8,455 sand containers) and cost about €432.000.									8. Effectiveness (i.e. were the foreseen goals/objectives of the work reached?)									Sand nourishment was started in the early 1970s. Therefore, the experiences with the different measures were based on long-term experience. Sand nourishment was necessary in high erosion areas to stop coastal decline. In 2009, sand nourishment is still seen as the most efficient measure economically with least environmental impact to protect the coastal dunes from erosion and decline.  									9. Success and Fail factors									Natural coastal dynamics are acknowledged in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern. The national park areas, areas where no protection of built-up areas is a legal requirement, and natural cliff sites are left to natural coastal dynamics. Maintenance is dynamic following the notions “hold the line” with “limited intervention” if possible. Of 377 km outer coast only 120 km of low-lying and 15 km of cliff areas are protected by hard measures, less than 50%. Hard constructions are the exception: they are not a long-term solution, are expensive, and hamper tourism, ecology, and landscape aesthetics. Sand nourishment creates wide sand beaches increasing the recreational value of the beaches. 									10. Unforeseen outcomes									Long-term effects of sand extraction are not well known. In Warnemünde further protection from storm floods is needed at the river and harbour side of Warnemünde, different types and combinations of hard constructions are planned that are suitable for traffic lines (streets, train, harbour, promenade) and integrate into the image of the city. 									11.

Experiences that can be exchanged									In the event of a problem on the coast, this tool will enable us to define which studies must be conducted, the spatial and time scales to be applied, the numerical tools to be used and the input data required for our study. The effects of this problem on the coast can be precisely determined.									4. Overview of the case									The Coastal Management Modelling System (Sistema De Modelado Costero, SMC) is a computer tool that features a collection of numerical methods and models that enable us to study coastal processes and assess any changes in a beach due to natural events or human actions on the coast. The SMC is used to conduct studies on real coastal engineering projects, analysing actions throughout the different stages of a study: diagnosis, pre-design, design and environmental impact. These different stages cover the following analysis: bathymetric information, flood level determination, wave and dynamics characterisation, modal and morpho-dynamic states, terrain modelling and equilibrium beach, beach morpho-dynamic evolution and beach cross profile evolution.									5. Context and Objectives									a) Context									The SMC is part of the project &quot;Coastal Modelling Aid System&quot;. This project was developed by the University of Cantabria for the Directorate General of Coasts of the Spanish Ministry of Environment. Both institutions agreed in 2002 to collaborate on the &quot;Diffusion and distribution of numerical models for the technical assistance to the development of a model for coastal management&quot;. The aims of the Agreement are: 																																To allow and facilitate an adequate distribution of the models to the different administrations, universities, and consulting groups related to the coast.													To ensure that these institutions have sufficient information and knowledge of the developed tools. To this effect, courses will be held via Internet to instruct end-users on the usage of the model.																															This tool has been designed to be implemented at the National, Regional or Local scale.									b) Objectives									The specific objectives to be achieved with the ICZM approach were: (1) to increase the knowledge on the dynamics and evolution of the coastal systems; (2) to design the necessary procedures to avoid beach recession and flooding in low coastal areas; (3) to establish a methodology in the design, execution and follow-up of the procedures carried out on the Spanish coast; (4) to develop a series of numerical tools that allows the application of the established methodologies; (5) compile the Spanish experience in the coastal engineering field.									The timescale associated with the implementation and goals achievement was 4 years (1996-2000)									6. Implementation of the ICZM Approach (i.e. management, tools, resources)									a) Project Management									This software was developed by the Environmental Hydraulics Institute IH Cantabria (formerly Ocean and Coastal Research Group from the University of Cantabria) and the Directorate General to the Coast in the Spain Ministry of Environment, within the Research Project  &quot;Coastal Modelling Aid System&quot;, funded by the Ministry of Environment.									b) ICZM tools									The SMC is a technical and planning tool, including the following modules:																																ODIN module which characterises the waves commonly needed by the user and can determine the mean directional wave regimes (wave height and period) at indefinite and target depths, the wave characteristics associated with the mean energy flow and the waves which characterise the annual, averaged conditions.													BACO module which provides the end-user with bathymetric information available for the study zone. It provides image based and digitised, digital nautical charts (bathymetric data) and the possibility to generate an SMC project.													ATLAS module which presents the visualisation of the results obtained in the thematic document on flood levels. It allows us to obtain the mean and extreme tidal and flood regimes for the Spanish coast.													MOPLA module which allows the numerical simulation of wave propagations from indefinite depths towards the coast line. With this data, the induced current in the break zone can be obtained; therefore the morpho-dynamic evolution of a beach can be simulated.													PETRA module which studies the short term cross-profile evolution. The model solves the sediment flow equations within the break zone as well as the bathymetric changes associated with the spatial variation in the sediment transportation. It aims to study the response of the beach plant form during a storm in regards to the coast line recession and the resulting beach profile.													TIC module which compiles into one interactive document the most useful formulas and procedures used in coastal engineering. The programme is made up of a series of basic units for each particular issue. Each unit is separated into four subject groups: dynamics, sedimentary processes, marine works and environmental impacts.																															7. Cost and resources									The budget for the design and implementation of this tool was €1,500,000. The manpower used for the implementation of the tool was approximately 45 people.									8. Effectiveness (i.e. were the foreseen goals/objectives of the work reached?)									The Spanish experience in the field of coastal engineering has been collected, analysed and used for the design of this tool which provides the necessary information to study and understand the coastal dynamics of a study zone as well as to design the specific measures to face and solve a specific coastal problem in the area. The objectives were achieved in the timescale defined.									9. Success and Fail factors									Factors that were helpful in achieving the objective were: (1) the political will of the person in charge at the competent administration (Director General for the Coast) to promote the training and capacity building of their technical staff in the Ministry of Environment; (2) the failure of several beach re-generation initiatives (carried out with the same methodologies that had previously succeeded) and the lack of understanding about why they had failed; (3) the budget availability; (4) free dissemination of the modelling tool.									A factor that hindered the achievement of the goals was the political changes in the first year of the project with the subsequent risks of budget cuts and/or failure.									10. Unforeseen outcomes									 (1) The definition of a methodology to study the coastal processes based on short term and long term assessments; (2) the definition of the corresponding numerical methods and models which are nowadays the most used in Spain; (3) the creation of several databases for the tool, including waves and currents data, nautical charts etc.; (4) the use of the SMC in international cooperation projects, giving the software to coastal administration and training their technical staff. There is need for a continuous updating and upgrading.									11. Prepared by									Pino González-Riancho, Environmental Hydraulics Institute IH Cantabria, Spain.									12.

Experiences that can be exchanged									An urban and landscape consortium which includes all the competent administrations to solve a specific problem is an effective way of integrating all the sectors, interests and actors, ensuring information exchange and transparency, while at the same time accelerating the bureaucratic mechanisms.									4. Overview of the case									An agreement between several Administrations has been signed to ensure co-operation for the development and increase the value of the tourism activity in a mature Balearic tourist destination. A key issue in this project is the role of the Spanish Government, creating the post of Commissioner for the Palma Beach Consortium who reports directly to the Council of Ministers of the Spanish Government. The agreement results in the establishment of a Town Planning Consortium. The aim of that Consortium is to design and develop a plan to achieve a new tourism model which incorporates sustainability and climate change issues.									5. Context and Objectives									a) Context									The Balearic Islands, in the western Mediterranean, are made up of four main islands and several islets. Mallorca is the largest island of the archipelago and offers many pocket beaches along its northern and south eastern coasts. The largest beaches are located at both, the Alcudia and Palma bay. White sand and transparent water beaches often finishing at dunes and macchia forests are a constant feature of the coastal landscape. Its natural richness and the summer weather, as well as its proximity to the major focus of European tourism, have favoured the success of a non-stop tourist activity since the sixties. However, that tourism model, based on mass-tourism resorts and residential developments, sometimes occupying fields of dunes and disturbing the equilibrium of coastal – physical and biological - systems, has resulted in an unsustainable model. Platja de Palma Beach is nowadays a mature tourist destination and is not currently satisfying the needs and expectations of society. This is why the Consortium has been created, in order to couple the values and potentials of that tourist destination with a sustainable development framework and integrating and promoting the co-operation between the different administrations involved in Platja de Palma Beach.									b) Objectives									The mission: “With all eyes on 2020 we hope to have transformed Platja de Palma into an innovative, prosperous and sustainable destination which will be a worldwide reference for other mature tourist destinations” The agreement between the involved authorities and organisations aims to carry out cooperation and integration-based initiatives for the tourism development of Platja de Palma Beach including infrastructure provision, as well as land-use, urban and natural resources zoning and planning. These initiatives are based on two tools: a master plan for the restoration of the tourist areas and an urban consortium to fulfil all those land-use and urban-related decisions in the plan. Therefore, the objectives of the Urban Consortium, to be achieved by means of the integration of all the competent Administrations, are (1) to formulate the new planning of the study zone, and (2) to promote, execute and manage the foreseen urban, equipment and infrastructure works. The Plan for Platja de Palma Beach includes short-term and long-term goals, existing activities that look for results in a 5 year period viz. infrastructures, social programmes, and others seeking longer ones, such as 10-20 years viz. reduction of CO2 emissions, water treatments, etc.									6. Implementation of the ICZM Approach (i.e. management, tools, resources)									a) Management									The Consortium is made up of 5 institutions: The Secretary of State for tourism from the Ministry of Industry, Tourism and Trade of Spain (national), the Autonomous Community of the Balearic Islands (Regional Government), the Council of Mallorca (provincial) and the Councils of Palma and Llucmajor (locals Governments). The level of importance and responsibility in the decision-making is the following: out of a total of 9 votes, 3 correspond to the State, 3 to the Autonomous Community, 1 to the province and 1 to the two Local Councils. Decisions are taken by simple majority and occasionally unanimously.									b) ICZM tools									The Urban Consortium is a planning and land management tool: it has developed a Plan to restore tourist areas, which integrates the interests of all the administrations with competences in tourism and spatial/urban planning and management. It can develop specific planning or management proposals and agreements, collaboration between administrations, hard and soft constructions, etc. The specific actions that can be carried out by the Consortium are the following: (1) Writing, managing, approving, checking or modifying the planning and management tools for the execution of urban planning; (2) Promoting the checking of natural resources, spatial and urban planning, (3) Writing and approving projects, (4) Inviting tenders of and contracting works, (5) Elaborating urban management proposals; (6) Endorsing urban planning/management agreements, (7)  Urban licence/permit granting, (8) Promoting the involvement of other Administrations, Public Entities and privates in the Consortium, (9) Collaborating with Consortium members to accelerate the bureaucratic mechanisms, Etc.									Participation tools: 																																a website  for the Urban Consortium has been created to make all the related information available to any interested person,													public participation is a key issue in the Palma Beach Consortium activities. There are several workshops with neighbours, hotel owners, commercial offers, etc previous to the plan design. Additionally the official participation processes and filing of  allegations required by any plan or project are going strictly to carry out,													all the actors have been identified and both the Plan for the restoration of the tourist infrastructures and the Plan have been distributed among them; after this information process several participation and discussion sessions are carried out to achieve consensus-based proposals.																															Coordination tools: 																																the Governance Board, which is composed of the Consortium members, formally meets once each month and its sessions are called by the Consortium President;													the Monitoring Commission, composed by the Governance Board, the Consortium staff  and the external experts who develop each of the seven strategies.  Usually meeting once a month.													Coordination agreements promoted by the Consortium are signed with the main specific actors, such as policy-makers, tourist entrepreneurs, trade unions and citizens with the aim of ensuring continuity and Governance for change.													On December 2004, all the administrations with competence on tourism and spatial/urban planning and management, signed a co-operation agreement to establish the &quot;Consortium for the improvement and the embellishment of the Playa de Palma, as an instrument of common organisation for the management of a convention collaborative framework for the implementation of the Renovation Plan of the tourist area of the Bay of Palma.													On September 2008, a new age in the management of the Consortium was opened, with the appointment by the Council of Ministers of Spain of Margarita Najera, as Commissioner of the Government for the development of the Plan for the transformation of the touristic destination																															7. Cost and resources									The budget for the implementation of the Plan for 2010 is €127,700,000, funded by the involved Administrations. The budget for the Urban Consortium comes from the involved Administrations. The manpower currently being used for the implementation of the tool is 9 people: 1 manager, 6 technical staff and 4 administrative staff. 									8. Effectiveness (i.e. were the foreseen goals/objectives of the work reached?)									The effectiveness of the consortium has been high. In the first year of existence it has developed urgent actions related to urban works and accessibility, and is addressing the design of an integral Plan for the restoration of the tourist area. In July 2010, the strategic Plan will be presented to the Presidency of Spain, thereafter the main actions of the Plan will start to be developed. The current staff, managed by the Commissioner of the Government, introduced on May 2009 the basic preliminaries of the revaluation of Playa de Palma. The strategic plan will be presented during the next month, after the adoption of the law of playa de Palma, by the parliament of the Balearic Islands. Meanwhile small improvement have been carried out on infrastructures with a € 6 m budget. 									9. Success and Fail factors									An important factor that was helpful in achieving the objective was that all the actors involved recognise the necessity of changing the tourist model. Additionally all the entities included in the Consortium have the competences required to achieve the Consortium’s goals. Also, the high tourist and environmental degradation of the zone that increases the need for reforms in the tourist sector; the global crisis that highlights the need for a more competitive and modern tourist area to get benefits from it, as it was declining; the existence of a legal framework promoting the achievement of a more competitive and sustainable tourism model in Spain (Spanish Tourism Plan 2020- Spanish Tourism Plan 2008-2012) which also promotes the definition of a re-qualification programme for mature tourist destinations; and the achievement of a more competitive, sustainable, integrated and consensus-based tourism model in Balearic Islands (Llibre Blanc del Turisme, 2009). In order to avoid the threat of changes policies, the Plan will be garanteed and ratified by all parties that constitute the parliament of the Balearic Islands.  									10.

Council Directive 92/43/EEC

of 21 May 1992

on the conservation of natural habitats and of wild fauna and flora


THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,

Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community, and in particular Article 130s thereof,

Having regard to the proposal from the Commission(1),

Having regard to the opinion of the European Parliament(2),

Having regard to the opinion of the Economic and Social Committee(3),

Whereas the preservation, protection and improvement of the quality of the environment, including the conservation of natural habitats and of wild fauna and flora, are an essential objective of general interest pursued by the Community, as stated in Article 130r of the Treaty;

Whereas the European Community policy and action programme on the environment (1987 to 1992)(4) makes provision for measures regarding the conservation of nature and natural resources;

Whereas, the main aim of this Directive being to promote the maintenance of biodiversity, taking account of economic, social, cultural and regional requirements, this Directive makes a contribution to the general objective of sustainable development; whereas the maintenance of such biodiversity may in certain cases require the maintenance, or indeed the encouragement, of human activities;

Whereas, in the European territory of the Member States, natural habitats are continuing to deteriorate and an increasing number of wild species are seriously threatened; whereas given that the threatened habitats and species form part of the Community''s natural heritage and the threats to them are often of a transboundary nature, it is necessary to take measures at Community level in order to conserve them;

Whereas, in view of the threats to certain types of natural habitat and certain species, it is necessary to define them as having priority in order to favour the early implementation of measures to conserve them;

Whereas, in order to ensure the restoration or maintenance of natural habitats and species of Community interest at a favourable conservation status, it is necessary to designate special areas of conservation in order to create a coherent European ecological network according to a specified timetable;

Whereas all the areas designated, including those classified now or in the future as special protection areas pursuant to Council Directive 79/409/EEC of 2 April 1979 on the conservation of wild birds(5), will have to be incorporated into the coherent European ecological network;

Whereas it is appropriate, in each area designated, to implement the necessary measures having regard to the conservation objectives pursued;

Whereas sites eligible for designation as special areas of conservation are proposed by the Member States but whereas a procedure must nevertheless be laid down to allow the designation in exceptional cases of a site which has not been proposed by a Member State but which the Community considers essential for either the maintenance or the survival of a priority natural habitat type or a priority species;

Whereas an appropriate assessment must be made of any plan or programme likely to have a significant effect on the conservation objectives of a site which has been designated or is designated in future;

Whereas it is recognized that the adoption of measures intended to promote the conservation of priority natural habitats and priority species of Community interest is a common responsibility of all Member States; whereas this may, however, impose an excessive financial burden on certain Member States given, on the one hand, the uneven distribution of such habitats and species throughout the Community and, on the other hand, the fact that the "polluter pays" principle can have only limited application in the special case of nature conservation;

Whereas it is therefore agreed that, in this exceptional case, a contribution by means of Community co-financing should be provided for within the limits of the resources made available under the Community''s decisions;

Whereas land-use planning and development policies should encourage the management of features of the landscape which are of major importance for wild fauna and flora;

Whereas a system should be set up for surveillance of the conservation status of the natural habitats and species covered by this Directive;

Whereas a general system of protection is required for certain species of flora and fauna to complement Directive 79/409/EEC; whereas provision should be made for management measures for certain species, if their conservation status so warrants, including the prohibition of certain means of capture or killing, whilst providing for the possibility of derogations on certain conditions;

Whereas, with the aim of ensuring that the implementation of this Directive is monitored, the Commission will periodically prepare a composite report based, inter alia, on the information sent to it by the Member States regarding the application of national provisions adopted under this Directive;

Whereas the improvement of scientific and technical knowledge is essential for the implementation of this Directive; whereas it is consequently appropriate to encourage the necessary research and scientific work;

Whereas technical and scientific progress mean that it must be possible to adapt the Annexes; whereas a procedure should be established whereby the Council can amend the Annexes;

Whereas a regulatory committee should be set up to assist the Commission in the implementation of this Directive and in particular when decisions on Community co-financing are taken;

Whereas provision should be made for supplementary measures governing the reintroduction of certain native species of fauna and flora and the possible introduction of non-native species;

Whereas education and general information relating to the objectives of this Directive are essential for ensuring its effective implementation,

HAS ADOPTED THIS DIRECTIVE:


Definitions

Article 1

For the purpose of this Directive:

(m) specimen means any animal or plant, whether alive or dead, of the species listed in Annex IV and Annex V, any part or derivative thereof, as well as any other goods which appear, from an accompanying document, the packaging or a mark or label, or from any other circumstances, to be parts or derivatives of animals or plants of those species;

(n) the committee means the committee set up pursuant to Article 20.


Article 2

1. The aim of this Directive shall be to contribute towards ensuring bio-diversity through the conservation of natural habitats and of wild fauna and flora in the European territory of the Member States to which the Treaty applies.

2. Measures taken pursuant to this Directive shall be designed to maintain or restore, at favourable conservation status, natural habitats and species of wild fauna and flora of Community interest.

3. Measures taken pursuant to this Directive shall take account of economic, social and cultural requirements and regional and local characteristics.


Conservation of natural habitats and habitats of species

Article 3

1. A coherent European ecological network of special areas of conservation shall be set up under the title Natura 2000. This network, composed of sites hosting the natural habitat types listed in Annex I and habitats of the species listed in Annex II, shall enable the natural habitat types and the species'' habitats concerned to be maintained or, where appropriate, restored at a favourable conservation status in their natural range.

The Natura 2000 network shall include the special protection areas classified by the Member States pursuant to Directive 79/409/EEC.

2. Each Member State shall contribute to the creation of Natura 2000 in proportion to the representation within its territory of the natural habitat types and the habitats of species referred to in paragraph 1. To that effect each Member State shall designate, in accordance with Article 4, sites as special areas of conservation taking account of the objectives set out in paragraph 1.

3. Where they consider it necessary, Member States shall endeavour to improve the ecological coherence of Natura 2000 by maintaining, and where appropriate developing, features of the landscape which are of major importance for wild fauna and flora, as referred to in Article 10.


Article 4

1. On the basis of the criteria set out in Annex III (Stage 1) and relevant scientific information, each Member State shall propose a list of sites indicating which natural habitat types in Annex I and which species in Annex II that are native to its territory the sites host. For animal species ranging over wide areas these sites shall correspond to the places within the natural range of such species which present the physical or biological factors essential to their life and reproduction. For aquatic species which range over wide areas, such sites will be proposed only where there is a clearly identifiable area representing the physical and biological factors essential to their life and reproduction. Where appropriate, Member States shall propose adaptation of the list in the light of the results of the surveillance referred to in Article 11.

The list shall be transmitted to the Commission, within three years of the notification of this Directive, together with information on each site. That information shall include a map of the site, its name, location, extent and the data resulting from application of the criteria specified in Annex III (Stage 1) provided in a format established by the Commission in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 21.

2. On the basis of the criteria set out in Annex III (Stage 2) and in the framework both of each of the five biogeographical regions referred to in Article 1 (c) (iii) and of the whole of the territory referred to in Article 2 (1), the Commission shall establish, in agreement with each Member State, a draft list of sites of Community importance drawn from the Member States'' lists identifying those which lost one or more priority natural habitat types or priority species.

Member States whose sites hosting one or more priority natural habitat types and priority species represent more than 5 % of their national territory may, in agreement with the Commission, request that the criteria listed in Annex III (Stage 2) be applied more flexibly in selecting all the sites of Community importance in their territory.

The list of sites selected as sites of Community importance, identifying those which host one or more priority natural habitat types or priority species, shall be adopted by the Commission in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 21.

3. The list referred to in paragraph 2 shall be established within six years of the notification of this Directive.

4. Once a site of Community importance has been adopted in accordance with the procedure laid down in paragraph 2, the Member State concerned shall designate that site as a special area of conservation as soon as possible and within six years at most, establishing priorities in the light of the importance of the sites for the maintenance or restoration, at a favourable conservation status, of a natural habitat type in Annex I or a species in Annex II and for the coherence of Natura 2000, and in the light of the threats of degradation or destruction to which those sites are exposed.

5. As soon as a site is placed on the list referred to in the third subparagraph of paragraph 2 it shall be subject to Article 6 (2), (3) and (4).


Article 5

1. In exceptional cases where the Commission finds that a national list as referred to in Article 4 (1) fails to mention a site hosting a priority natural habitat type or priority species which, on the basis of relevant and reliable scientific information, it considers to be essential for the maintenance of that priority natural habitat type or for the survival of that priority species, a bilateral consultation procedure shall be initiated between that Member State and the Commission for the purpose of comparing the scientific data used by each.

2. If, on expiry of a consultation period not exceeding six months, the dispute remains unresolved, the Commission shall forward to the Council a proposal relating to the selection of the site as a site of Community importance.

3. The Council, acting unanimously, shall take a decision within three months of the date of referral.

4. During the consultation period and pending a Council decision, the site concerned shall be subject to Article 6 (2).


Article 6

1. For special areas of conservation, Member States shall establish the necessary conservation measures involving, if need be, appropriate management plans specifically designed for the sites or integrated into other development plans, and appropriate statutory, administrative or contractual measures which correspond to the ecological requirements of the natural habitat types in Annex I and the species in Annex II present on the sites.

2. Member States shall take appropriate steps to avoid, in the special areas of conservation, the deterioration of natural habitats and the habitats of species as well as disturbance of the species for which the areas have been designated, in so far as such disturbance could be significant in relation to the objectives of this Directive.

3. Any plan or project not directly connected with or necessary to the management of the site but likely to have a significant effect thereon, either individually or in combination with other plans or projects, shall be subject to appropriate assessment of its implications for the site in view of the site''s conservation objectives. In the light of the conclusions of the assessment of the implications for the site and subject to the provisions of paragraph 4, the competent national authorities shall agree to the plan or project only after having ascertained that it will not adversely affect the integrity of the site concerned and, if appropriate, after having obtained the opinion of the general public.

4. If, in spite of a negative assessment of the implications for the site and in the absence of alternative solutions, a plan or project must nevertheless be carried out for imperative reasons of overriding public interest, including those of a social or economic nature, the Member State shall take all compensatory measures necessary to ensure that the overall coherence of Natura 2000 is protected. It shall inform the Commission of the compensatory measures adopted.

Where the site concerned hosts a priority natural habitat type and/or a priority species, the only considerations which may be raised are those relating to human health or public safety, to beneficial consequences of primary importance for the environment or, further to an opinion from the Commission, to other imperative reasons of overriding public interest.


Article 7

Obligations arising under Article 6 (2), (3) and (4) of this Directive shall replace any obligations arising under the first sentence of Article 4 (4) of Directive 79/409/EEC in respect of areas classified pursuant to Article 4 (1) or similarly recognized under Article 4 (2) thereof, as from the date of implementation of this Directive or the date of classification or recognition by a Member State under Directive 79/409/EEC, where the latter date is later.


Article 8

1. In parallel with their proposals for sites eligible for designation as special areas of conservation, hosting priority natural habitat types and/or priority species, the Member States shall send, as appropriate, to the Commission their estimates relating to the Community co-financing which they consider necessary to allow them to meet their obligations pursuant to Article 6 (1).

2. In agreement with each of the Member States concerned, the Commission shall identify, for sites of Community importance for which co-financing is sought, those measures essential for the maintenance or re-establishment at a favourable conservation status of the priority natural habitat types and priority species on the sites concerned, as well as the total costs arising from those measures.

3. The Commission, in agreement with the Member States concerned, shall assess the financing, including co-financing, required for the operation of the measures referred to in paragraph 2, taking into account, amongst other things, the concentration on the Member State''s territory of priority natural habitat types and/or priority species and the relative burdens which the required measures entail.

4. According to the assessment referred to in paragraphs 2 and 3, the Commission shall adopt, having regard to the available sources of funding under the relevant Community instruments and according to the procedure set out in Article 21, a prioritized action framework of measures involving co-financing to be taken when the site has been designated under Article 4 (4).

5. The measures which have not been retained in the action framework for lack of sufficient resources, as well as those included in the abovementioned action framework which have not received the necessary co-financing or have only been partially co-financed, shall be reconsidered in accordance with the procedure set out in Article 21, in the context of the two-yearly review of the action framework and may, in the maintime, be postponed by the Member States pending such review. This review shall take into account, as appropriate, the new situation of the site concerned.

6. In areas where the measures dependent on co-financing are postponed, Member States shall refrain from any new measures likely to result in deterioration of those areas.


Article 9

The Commission, acting in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 21, shall periodically review the contribution of Natura 2000 towards achievement of the objectives set out in Article 2 and 3. In this context, a special area of conservation may be considered for declassification where this is warranted by natural developments noted as a result of the surveillance provided for in Article 11.


Article 10

Member States shall endeavour, where they consider it necessary, in their land-use planning and development policies and, in particular, with a view to improving the ecological coherence af the Natura 2000 network, to encourage the management of features of the landscape which are of major importance for wild fauna and flora.

Such features are those which, by virtue of their linear and continuous structure (such as rivers with their banks or the traditional systems for marking field boundaries) or their function as stepping stones (such as ponds or small woods), are essential for the migration, dispersal and genetic exchange of wild species.


Article 11

Member States shall undertake surveillance of the conservation status of the natural habitats and species referred to in Article 2 with particular regard to priority natural habitat types and priority species.


Protection of species

Article 12

1. Member States shall take the requisite measures to establish a system of strict protection for the animal species listed in Annex IV (a) in their natural range, prohibiting:

(a) all forms of deliberate capture or killing of specimens of these species in the wild;

(b) deliberate disturbance of these species, particularly during the period of breeding, rearing, hibernation and migration;

(c) deliberate destruction or taking of eggs from the wild;

(d) deterioration or destruction of breeding sites or resting places.

2. For these species, Member States shall prohibit the keeping, transport and sale or exchange, and offering for sale or exchange, of specimens taken from the wild, except for those taken legally before this Directive is implemented.

3. The prohibition referred to in paragraph 1 (a) and (b) and paragraph 2 shall apply to all stages of life of the animals to which this Article applies.

4. Member States shall establish a system to monitor the incidential capture and killing of the animal species listed in Annex IV (a). In the light of the information gathered, Member States shall take further research or conservation measures as required to ensure that incidental capture and killing does not have a significant negative impact on the species concerned.


Article 13

1. Member States shall take the requisite measures to establish a system of strict protection for the plant species listed in Annex IV (b), prohibiting:

(a) the deliberate picking, collecting, cutting, uprooting or destruction of such plants in their natural range in the wild;

(b) the keeping, transport and sale or exchange and offering for sale or exchange of specimens of such species taken in the wild, except for those taken legally before this Directive is implemented.

2. The prohibitions referred to in paragraph 1 (a) and (b) shall apply to all stages of the biological cycle of the plants to which this Article applies.


Article 14

1. If, in the light of the surveillance provided for in Article 11, Member States deem it necessary, they shall take measures to ensure that the taking in the wild of specimens of species of wild fauna and flora listed in Annex V as well as their exploitation is compatible with their being maintained at a favourable conservation status.

2. Where such measures are deemed necessary, they shall include continuation of the surveillance provided for in Article 11. Such measures may also include in particular:

- regulations regarding access to certain property,

- temporary or local prohibition of the taking of specimens in the wild and exploitation of certain populations,

- regulation of the periods and/or methods of taking specimens,

- application, when specimens are taken, of hunting and fishing rules which take account of the conservation of such populations,

- establishment of a system of licences for taking specimens or of quotas,

- regulation of the purchase, sale, offering for sale, keeping for sale or transport for sale of specimens,

- breeding in captivity of animal species as well as artificial propagation of plant species, under strictly controlled conditions, with a view to reducing the taking of specimens of the wild,

- assessment of the effect of the measures adopted.


Article 15

In respect of the capture or killing of species of wild fauna listed in Annex V (a) and in cases where, in accordance with Article 16, derogations are applied to the taking, capture or killing of species listed in Annex IV (a), Member States shall prohibit the use of all indiscriminate means capable of causing local disappearance of, or serious disturbance to, populations of such species, and in particular:

(a) use of the means of capture and killing listed in Annex VI (a);

(b) any form of capture and killing from the modes of transport referred to in Annex VI (b).


Article 16

1. Provided that there is no satisfactory alternative and the derogation is not detrimental to the maintenance of the populations of the species concerned at a favourable conservation status in their natural range, Member States may derogate from the provisions of Articles 12, 13, 14 and 15 (a) and (b):

(a) in the interest of protecting wild fauna and flora and conserving natural habitats;

(b) to prevent serious damage, in particular to crops, livestock, forests, fisheries and water and other types of property;

(c) in the interests of public health and public safety, or for other imperative reasons of overriding public interest, including those of a social or economic nature and beneficial consequences of primary importance for the environment;

(d) for the purpose of research and education, of repopulating and re-introducing these species and for the breedings operations necessary for these purposes, including the artificial propagation of plants;

(e) to allow, under strictly supervised conditions, on a selective basis and to a limited extent, the taking or keeping of certain specimens of the species listed in Annex IV in limited numbers specified by the competent national authorities.

2. Member States shall forward to the Commission every two years a report in accordance with the format established by the Committee on the derogations applied under paragraph 1. The Commission shall give its opinion on these derogations within a maximum time limit of 12 months following receipt of the report and shall give an account to the Committee.

3. The reports shall specify:

(a) the species which are subject to the derogations and the reason for the derogation, including the nature of the risk, with, if appropriate, a reference to alternatives rejected and scientific data used;

(b) the means, devices or methods authorized for the capture or killing of animal species and the reasons for their use;

(c) the circumstances of when and where such derogations are granted;

(d) the authority empowered to declare and check that the required conditions obtain and to decide what means, devices or methods may be used, within what limits and by what agencies, and which persons are to carry but the task;

(e) the supervisory measures used and the results obtained.

ANNEX III


CRITERIA FOR SELECTING SITES ELIGIBLE FOR IDENTIFICATION AS SITES OF COMMUNITY IMPORTANCE AND DESIGNATION AS SPECIAL AREAS OF CONSERVATION

STAGE 1: Assessment at national level of the relative importance of sites for each natural habitat type in Annex I and each species in Annex II (including priority natural habitat types and priority species)

A. Site assessment criteria for a given natural habitat type in Annex I

(a) Degree of representativity of the natural habitat tpye on the site.

(b) Area of the site covered by the natural habitat type in relation to the total area covered by that natural habitat type within national territory.

(c) Degree of conservation of the structure and functions of the natural habitat type concerned and restoration possibilities.

(d) Global assessment of the value of the site for conservation of the natural habitat type concerned.

B. Site assessment criteria for a given species in Annex II

(a) Size and density of the population of the species present on the site in relation to the populations present within national territory.

(b) Degree of conservation of the features of the habitat which are important for the species concerned and restoration possibilities.

(c) Degree of isolation of the population present on the site in relation to the natural range of the species.

(d) Global assessment of the value of the site for conservation of the species concerned.

C. On the basis of these criteria, Member States will classify the sites which they propose on the national list as sites eligible for identification as sites of Community importance according to their relative value for the conservation of each natural habitat type in Annex I or each species in Annex II.

D. That list will show the sites containing the priority natural habitat types and priority species selected by the Member States on the basis of the criteria in A and B above.

STAGE 2: Assessment of the Community importance of the sites included on the national lists

1. All the sites identified by the Member States in Stage 1 which contain priority natural habitat types and/or species will be considered as sites of Community importance.

2. The assessment of the Community importance of other sites on Member States'' lists, i.e. their contribution to maintaining or re-establishing, at a favourable conservation status, a natural habitat in Annex I or a species in Annex II and/or to the coherence of Natura 2000 will take account of the following criteria:

(a) relative value of the site at national level;

(b) geographical situation of the site in relation to migration routes of species in Annex II and whether it belongs to a continuous ecosystem situated on both sides of one or more internal Community frontiers;

(c) total area of the site;

(d) number of natural habitat types in Annex I and species in Annex II present on the site;

(e) global ecological value of the site for the biogeographical regions concerned and/or for the whole of the territory referred to in Article 2, as regards both the characteristic of unique aspect of its features and the way they are combined.

Experiences that can be exchanged									Technical measures are often referred to as “hard solutions” and system-based measures as “soft solutions”. The core of the system-based approach is the fact that natural processes are given as much free reign as possible within a delta area. Only then can a delta adjust to changing circumstances such as those brought about by climate change. In principle, there are four possible strategies by which natural processes can be given the scope they need.									4. Overview of the case									A system-based approach aims to harness and use dynamic forces and create a dynamic equilibrium between land and water. Four strategies of system-based measures can be distinguished with the extent to which measures could contribute to the continued existence of deltas partly dependent on the space and scope available within a given delta. Which measure can best be taken depends on local ecological, economic and social circumstances. 									5. Context and Objectives									a) Context									Where a river enters an ocean or sea, sediments transported by the river are deposited. As layer upon layer is deposited a platform of sediment, the delta, is built up and rises above sea level. At the seaside of the delta erosive forces like currents, tides and waves play a role. As long as the net rate of sediment supply exceeds the rate of removal a delta will build seawards. Their fertile soil, presence of fresh water and the proximity  of transport routes over river and sea make them an ideal place to live and for economic activities. However there is a downside: lying in the low coastal zone makes deltas vulnerable to all kinds of disasters like hurricanes and tsunamis. In the future this vulnerability will only further increase, because of sea level rise as a result of climate change. The global temperature is set to increase by a few degrees, resulting in the weather becoming much more extreme in many places, with more storms and changed river discharges. The sea level will also rise faster than in the preceding centuries. These changes will have a severe impact on the natural processes in deltas and in the lives of those living in these areas. Deltas will be affected by climate change, probably in the near future and  the future of people and their economies is at stake as well.									As long as the natural processes in a delta are allowed to run their course and sufficient sediment is transported, a delta can grow at the same rate as a rising sea level. But inhabitants of deltas have been adapting their environment for centuries to suit their own needs. The main effects of human interventions is a shortage of sediment and the disruption of the natural processes. Consequently, the relative influence of the sea increases, resulting in erosion at the delta front and subsidence of the delta. As a result affected deltas are no longer able to respond to modified circumstances such as climate change. For inhabitants of the delta area, this means an increased risk of flooding. Until recently, society relied on technical engineering measures. A re-appraisal of natural, geo-morphological processes, however, is currently gaining in importance. A fuller consideration of natural, dynamic forces in a delta, in an integrated, system-based approach seems to be a more flexible and promising way to cope with climate changes.									b) Objectives									Until recently, society relied on technical engineering measures. A re-appraisal of natural, geo-morphological processes, however, is currently gaining in importance. A fuller consideration of natural, dynamic forces in a delta, in an integrated, system-based approach seems to be a more flexible and promising way to cope with climate changes.									6. Implementation of the ICZM Approach (i.e. management, tools, resources)									a) Project Management									The  work was carried out in the framework of the Dutch National Research Programmes Climate changes Spatial Planning and Living with Water and commissioned by the International Association of Dredging Companies (IADC) and World Wide Fund for Nature Netherlands (WWF).									b) ICZM tools									Four strategies of system-based measures can be distinguished: physical measures aimed at:- the management of sediment; the management of water, adaptation of human behaviour and no action. The extent to which measures could contribute to the continued existence of deltas is greatly depending on the space and scope available within a given delta. Which measure can best be taken depends on local geo-morphological,  ecological, economic and social circumstances. It will not be possible to save an entire delta with a single type of “soft” intervention. System-based measures will not be sufficiently effective to completely exclude the need for technical measures. However, on a smaller scale and locally, system-based measures can be adequately effective. Strategies 1 and 2 consist of permanent, physical measures that influence the water and/or sediment management of the delta. These measures can include full or partial system recovery or the steering of natural processes in the delta system. In strategy 3, no measures are carried out with regard to the actual delta processes but human use of the delta is modified. The distribution of people and activities in a delta can be regulated with spatial planning. In addition, solutions that limit the damage as much as possible, compensation by means of an emergency fund or insurance and the temporary evacuation of residents during floods are part of this strategy. 									From the available data three simple, generic indicators were extracted that provide a first, quantitative glance of vulnerability, stocks at risk and the potential for system-based measures. These are: 1/100 yr surge height, people potentially flooded in 2000 and area of the coastal plain between 0 and 2 m above mean sea level. In addition to these generic indicators, a range of specific indicators is provided that can offer detailed informed on specific aspects of vulnerability, risk and the potential of system-based measures.									7. Cost and resources									No costs are available. 									8. Effectiveness (i.e. were the foreseen goals/objectives of the work reached?)									The system-based approach has two advantages over most technical measures: it is often cheaper and it is more sustainable in the long run. A disadvantage is that societies which have grown accustomed to the fixed equilibrium existing in many deltas today, will need to adapt their way of life in such a way that they can cope with the dynamic equilibrium associated with a system-based approach. This will in many cases not be easy. However, there is a lot at stake and both costs and sustainability are crucial when dealing with the question of how societies in deltas  can best cope with the effects of climate change. It should be borne in mind however, that a system-based approach can require “hard” interventions (e.g. constructing a dam to direct a sediment loaded longshore drift to the coast). Likewise, a “soft” intervention is not necessarily system-based. Ideally a system-based approach only requires a one-off intervention, after which natural processes take over as “custodians” of the area.									9. Success and Fail factors									In densely populated deltas, it will be difficult to take system-based measures that require a lot of space. In the case of deltas in poor countries, where the costs are much greater than the benefits, it may be an option not to take physical measures at all. Spatial planning is then a way of adaptation in which different zones in a delta are identified by which the spatial distribution of people and human activities is regulated. As a last resort, political measures (gradually removing the population from the delta ) and/or economic measures (insurance, compensation for losses) can be applied. Even if deltas cannot be fully protected by system-based measures, this can still be a suitable localized solution.									10. Unforeseen outcomes									None so far.									11.

Overview of the case									Historically, policies aimed at achieving coastal management in Northern Ireland have focused primarily on individual sectoral interests such as aquaculture and fisheries, environment, waste management and tourism. This sectoral approach to managing coastal issues was not representative of the ICZM principles as set out by the European Commission. The Northern Ireland ICZM Strategy seeks to identify key factors affecting Northern Ireland’s coast and put in place a series of widely supported aims at multiple governance levels through participation of relevant regulators and integration of common objectives and actions which will in turn promote a co-ordinated, sustainable approach to the future management of the coastal zone.									5. Context and Objectives									a) Context									The Northern Ireland coast is over 650km long and shows great diversity in coastal regime from the high-energy, rocky north coast open to the Atlantic Ocean to the low energy, high tidal range east coast which fronts on to the Irish. Many parts of the Northern Ireland coast are designated as ‘Areas of Outstanding Natural Beauty’, ‘Areas of Special Scientific Interest’ and/or ‘Marine Nature Reserves’. The Giant’s Causeway is also designated as a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The coast supports a large proportion of the Northern Ireland population and a great variety of economic activity as well as a range of leisure and recreational interests. The protection of the coastal and marine environment of Northern Ireland is shared among many Government and other non-statutory bodies. This approach can lead to disputes between departments that have conflicting management strategies and objectives. 									b) Objectives									The Northern Ireland ICZM Strategy sets out long-term objectives for achieving sustainable coastal management through improvements to existing management systems and the development of new management systems while simultaneously identifying and dealing with potential areas of conflict. The over-arching objective was to put in place a series of “widely supported aims, objectives and actions” that promotes a “coordinated and sustainable approach to the future management” of the Northern Ireland coastal zone.									6. Implementation of the ICZM Approach (i.e. management, tools, resources)									a) Management									In Northern Ireland the Department of Environment (DOE) is responsible for taking a lead on ICZM, however, given its integrated nature, this means that it impacts on most government departments and requires their collaboration. The Northern Ireland ICZM strategy was therefore developed in partnership with all relevant Government Departments. It is described as a ‘living document’, thereby reflecting the Government''s commitment to sustainable development through the key elements of society, environment, economics and integration. The strategy was informed by both direct consultation with coastal stakeholders and taking account of the wider policy context e.g. the UK Review of Marine Nature Conservation.									b) ICZM tools									The Strategy was developed through participation of all relevant Government departments, regulators and stakeholders. The strategy does not impose any new duties on regulators, public bodies, organisations or individuals. It does, however, advocate that relevant bodies use their existing powers to implement agreed actions. The strategy is organised according to four key themes: sustainable communities in the coastal zone; safeguarding and improving the environment within the coastal zone and maintaining and enhancing the economy of the coastal zone. This is supported by a cross-cutting theme, integration of planning and effort, to deliver these themes. Aims have been developed according to each theme covering topics such as sustainable communities, environment, economy and integration. A set of objectives, actions and indicators have been set out for each aim. Every attempt has been made to ensure the objectives are SMART (Strategic, Measurable, Achievable, Realistic and Time bound) however the strategy recognises that some work still needs to be done in relation to this given that some of the objectives will require consensus across the board. For each specific objective a responsible organisation is identified. In some cases there may be more than one responsible organisation. It is envisaged that the Strategy willimprove the way the coast is managed by promoting integrated management through encouraging bodies to work together and to consider management of the coastal zone as a whole. It will also promote a new approach to management that will bring users and regulators together to discuss and resolve issues at a local level. The strategy is accompanied by appointment of the Northern Ireland Coastal and Marine Forum (NICMF), a grouping of individuals from non governmental organisations with both thematic knowledge (from different sectors) and geographical responsibility  (e.g. via the non-statutory Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty [AONB] management bodies). One role of the NICMF is to monitor the implementation of the strategy and report on progress to government.									7. Cost and resources									A full time coastal officer within the Department of the Environment’s Planning and Natural Resources Division is devoted to ICZM. 									8. Effectiveness (i.e. were the foreseen goals/objectives of the work reached?)									The ICZM Strategy recognises that some form of structure should be established “as soon as possible” to oversee the implementation of the strategy. Northern Ireland has an operational Coastal and Marine Forum, whose role is to oversee and assist in the Government’s implementation of ICZM through several different types of activity specified in the Forum’s remit. The Coastal and Marine Forum is an independent, non-statutory body made up of a cross-section of interests ranging from local government, business, agriculture, community, fishing and environmental bodies as well as from various geographical areas (Causeway Coast, Strangford Lough and Mourne Coast). The Forum provides expert advice, co-ordinates research, and provides support towards the achievement of the strategy objectives. It is also responsible for monitoring government’s progress in implementing the Northern Ireland Strategy and reporting against the targets and objectives contained in it.									9. Success and Fail factors									At the time of the adoption of the ICZM strategy, there were no specific resources set aside for the implementation of the objectives. The majority of the objectives, therefore, were an integral part of existing daily duties and programmes of responsible organisations. ICZM activity has been viewed seriously enough by NI government to have published the strategy, established the Forum and provided resources for monitoring ICZM. In terms of Government action and engagement in ICZM as suggested in the EC Recommendation, the ICZM strategy in Northern Ireland arguably reflects a higher degree of government buy-in than any other UK administration. The fact that the strategy is non-binding could suggest that it lacks ‘teeth’. This in turn could result in slow progress in implementing ICZM or no progress on associated objectives and actions. Given its relatively recent adoption, however, this remains to be seen. 									10. Unforeseen outcomes									The inter-departmental group envisaged in the strategy was not set up. Instead the Forum Chair may report to a high level inter-departmental group established to oversee implementation of the Water Framework Directive. This group agreed to take on ICZM as an additional responsibility. Since ICZM is driven by a Recommendation it was deemed a success that a government group responsible for overseeing a Directive was prepared to take on a lower level additional responsibility.  									11.

This objective should be achieved by attracting potential investors and defining optimum locations for offshore wind farms, especially focused on principles of sustainable development, including preservation of nature values in marine cross-border areas.									5. Context and Objectives									a) Context									Lithuania, like all EU states, is expected to overcome the lack of reliable knowledge related to possibilities of offshore wind power development in marine areas of Lithuania and to plan investments into this kind of advanced renewable energy. According to an EU access agreement the State of Lithuania is obligated to produce no less than 7% of total energy consumption from renewable sources.									b) Objectives									The main goal is to create conditions for effective development of wind energy production in the Baltic Sea coastal zones of two neighbouring EU countries: Lithuania and Poland.									6. Implementation of the ICZM Approach (i.e. management, tools, resources)									a) Management									From the administrative point of view it is very convenient that the entire coastal zone of Lithuania belongs to one (Klaipeda) county, which comprises seven municipalities. However, the maritime part is also under the administration of the waterway authority. The final decision including the EIA approval(s) has to be taken by the Ministry of Environment.  									b) ICZM tools									The ICZM tools in this case study fall within the legislative and planning categories. It includes mainly spatial planning and multi-sectoral management planning. The offshore areas are used for different activities and are divided into different zones. Therefore it includes territorial planning and management plan preparation prior to the legal activities. 									7. Cost and resources									Since only the first stage of the case study has been implemented, the information about the final cost is not available.									8. Effectiveness (i.e. were the foreseen goals/objectives of the work reached?)									Generally, the spatial planning and legislative zonation of the Lithuanian coastal waters is considered to be a pre-requisite for the any economic development. Effectiveness has to be assessed more closely when first practical implementation works will be started. 									9. Success and Fail factors									The main success of the offshore park development will depend on foreseen investments, including foreign ones. However the attractiveness of the marine territories for such investments will depend on additional economical measures taken by the Lithuanian government to increase the competitiveness of the renewable energy sources. 									10. Unforeseen outcomes									It appeared that construction of offshore wind energy parks is much less complicated with regards to stakeholder conflict compared to the wind energy parks in the coastal environment where there is high recreation value. It also appeared that offshore wind farms could serve as a feature facilitating the mari-culture development in Lithuania. 									11.

Whereas:
(1) Council Directive 79/409/EEC of 2 April 1979 on the conservation of wild birds ( 3 ) has been substantially amended several times ( 4 ). In the interests of clarity and rationality the said Directive should be codified.
(2) Decision No 1600/2002/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 22 July 2002 laying down the Sixth Community Environment Action Programme ( 5 ) calls for specific action for biodiversity, including to protect birds and their habitats.
(3) A large number of species of wild birds naturally occurring in the European territory of the Member States are declining in number, very rapidly in some cases. This decline represents a serious threat to the conservation of the natural environment, particularly because of the biological balances threatened thereby.
(4) The species of wild birds naturally occurring in the European territory of the Member States are mainly migratory species. Such species constitute a common heritage and effective bird protection is typically a trans-frontier environment problem entailing common responsibilities.
(5) The conservation of the species of wild birds naturally occurring in the European territory of the Member States is necessary in order to attain the Community’s objectives regarding the improvement of living conditions and sustainable development.species of wild birds naturally occurring in the European territory of the Member States is necessary in order to attain the Community’s objectives regarding the improvement of living conditions and sustainable development.
(6) The measures to be taken must apply to the various factors which may affect the numbers of birds, namely the repercussions of man’s activities and in particular the destruction and pollution of their habitats, capture and killing by man and the trade resulting from such practices; the stringency of such measures should be adapted to the particular situation of the various species within the framework of a conservation policy.
(7) Conservation is aimed at the long-term protection and management of natural resources as an integral part of the heritage of the peoples of Europe. It makes it possible to control natural resources and governs their use on the basis of the measures necessary for the maintenance and adjustment of the natural balances between species as far as is reasonably possible.
(8) The preservation, maintenance or restoration of a sufficient diversity and area of habitats is essential to the conservation of all species of birds. Certain species of birds should be the subject of special conservation measures concerning their habitats in order to ensure their survival and reproduction in their area of distribution. Such measures must also take account of migratory species and be coordinated with a view to setting up a coherent whole.EN 26.1.2010 Official Journal of the European Union L 20/7

(9) In order to prevent commercial interests from exerting a possible harmful pressure on exploitation levels, it is necessary to impose a general ban on marketing and to restrict all derogation to those species whose biological status so permits, account being taken of the specific conditions obtaining in the different regions.
(10) Because of their high population level, geographical distribution and reproductive rate in the Community as a whole, certain species may be hunted, which constitutes acceptable exploitation where certain limits are established and respected, as such hunting must be compatible with maintenance of the population of these species at a satisfactory level.
(11) The various means, devices or methods of large-scale or non-selective capture or killing and hunting with certain forms of transport must be banned because of the excessive pressure which they exert or may exert on the numbers of the species concerned.
(12) Because of the importance which may be attached to certain specific situations, provision should be made for the possibility of derogations on certain conditions and subject to monitoring by the Commission.
(13) The conservation of birds and, in particular, migratory birds still presents problems which call for scientific research. Such research will also make it possible to assess the effectiveness of the measures taken.
(14) Care should be taken in consultation with the Commission to see that the introduction of any species of wild bird not naturally occurring in the European territory of the Member States does not cause harm to local flora and fauna.
(15) The Commission will every three years prepare and transmit to the Member States a composite report based on information submitted by the Member States on the application of national provisions introduced pursuant to this Directive.
(16) The measures necessary for the implementation of this Directive should be adopted in accordance with Council Decision 1999/468/EC of 28 June 1999 laying down the procedures for the exercise of implementing powers conferred on the Commission ( 1 ).
(17) In particular, the Commission should be empowered to amend certain Annexes in the light of scientific and technical progress. Since those measures are of general scope and are designed to amend non-essential elements of this Directive, they must be adopted in accordance with the regulatory procedure with scrutiny provided for in Article 5a of Decision 1999/468/EC.

Article 4
1. The species mentioned in Annex I shall be the subject of
special conservation measures concerning their habitat in order
to ensure their survival and reproduction in their area of
distribution.
In this connection, account shall be taken of:
(a) species in danger of extinction;
(b) species vulnerable to specific changes in their habitat;
(c) species considered rare because of small populations or
restricted local distribution;
(d) other species requiring particular attention for reasons of
the specific nature of their habitat.
Trends and variations in population levels shall be taken into
account as a background for evaluations.
Member States shall classify in particular the most suitable territories
in number and size as special protection areas for the
conservation of these species in the geographical sea and land
area where this Directive applies.
2. Member States shall take similar measures for regularly
occurring migratory species not listed in Annex I, bearing in
mind their need for protection in the geographical sea and land
area where this Directive applies, as regards their breeding,
moulting and wintering areas and staging posts along their
migration routes. To this end, Member States shall pay
particular attention to the protection of wetlands and
particularly to wetlands of international importance.
3. Member States shall send the Commission all relevant
information so that it may take appropriate initiatives with a
view to the coordination necessary to ensure that the areas
provided for in paragraphs 1 and 2 form a coherent whole
which meets the protection requirements of these species in
the geographical sea and land area where this Directive applies.
4. In respect of the protection areas referred to in paragraphs
1 and 2, Member States shall take appropriate steps to avoid
pollution or deterioration of habitats or any disturbances
affecting the birds, in so far as these would be significant
having regard to the objectives of this Article. Outside these
protection areas, Member States shall also strive to avoid
pollution or deterioration of habitats.
Article 5
Without prejudice to Articles 7 and 9, Member States shall take
the requisite measures to establish a general system of
protection for all species of birds referred to in Article 1,
prohibiting in particular:
(a) deliberate killing or capture by any method;
(b) deliberate destruction of, or damage to, their nests and eggs
or removal of their nests;
(c) taking their eggs in the wild and keeping these eggs even if
empty;
(d) deliberate disturbance of these birds particularly during the
period of breeding and rearing, in so far as disturbance
would be significant having regard to the objectives of
this Directive;
(e) keeping birds of species the hunting and capture of which is
prohibited.
Article 6
1. Without prejudice to paragraphs 2 and 3, Member States
shall prohibit, for all the bird species referred to in Article 1, the
sale, transport for sale, keeping for sale and the offering for sale
of live or dead birds and of any readily recognisable parts or
derivatives of such birds.
2. The activities referred to in paragraph 1 shall not be
prohibited in respect of the species referred to in Annex III,
Part A, provided that the birds have been legally killed or
captured or otherwise legally acquired.
3. Member States may, for the species listed in Annex III,
Part B, allow within their territory the activities referred to in
paragraph 1, making provision for certain restrictions, provided
that the birds have been legally killed or captured or otherwise
legally acquired.
Member States wishing to grant such authorisation shall first of
all consult the Commission with a view to examining jointly
with the latter whether the marketing of specimens of such
species would result or could reasonably be expected to result
in the population levels, geographical distribution or reproductive
rate of the species being endangered throughout the
Community. Should this examination prove that the intended
authorisation will, in the view of the Commission, result in any
one of the aforementioned species being thus endangered or in
the possibility of their being thus endangered, the Commission
shall forward a reasoned recommendation to the Member State
concerned stating its opposition to the marketing of the species
in question. Should the Commission consider that no such risk
exists, it shall inform the Member State concerned accordingly.
26.1.2010 EN Official Journal of the European Union L 20/9
The Commission’s recommendation shall be published in the
Official Journal of the European Union.
Member States granting authorisation pursuant to this
paragraph shall verify at regular intervals that the conditions
governing the granting of such authorisation continue to be
fulfilled.
Article 7
1. Owing to their population level, geographical distribution
and reproductive rate throughout the Community, the species
listed in Annex II may be hunted under national legislation.
Member States shall ensure that the hunting of these species
does not jeopardise conservation efforts in their distribution
area.
2. The species referred to in Annex II, Part A may be hunted
in the geographical sea and land area where this Directive
applies.
3. The species referred to in Annex II, Part B may be hunted
only in the Member States in respect of which they are
indicated.
4. Member States shall ensure that the practice of hunting,
including falconry if practised, as carried on in accordance with
the national measures in force, complies with the principles of
wise use and ecologically balanced control of the species of
birds concerned and that this practice is compatible as regards
the population of these species, in particular migratory species,
with the measures resulting from Article 2.
They shall see in particular that the species to which hunting
laws apply are not hunted during the rearing season or during
the various stages of reproduction.
In the case of migratory species, they shall see in particular that
the species to which hunting regulations apply are not hunted
during their period of reproduction or during their return to
their rearing grounds.
Member States shall send the Commission all relevant
information on the practical application of their hunting regulations.
Article 8
1. In respect of the hunting, capture or killing of birds under
this Directive, Member States shall prohibit the use of all means,
arrangements or methods used for the large-scale or nonselective
capture or killing of birds or capable of causing the
local disappearance of a species, in particular the use of those
listed in Annex IV, point (a).
2. Moreover, Member States shall prohibit any hunting from
the modes of transport and under the conditions mentioned in
Annex IV, point (b).
Article 9
1. Member States may derogate from the provisions of
Articles 5 to 8, where there is no other satisfactory solution,
for the following reasons:
(a) — in the interests of public health and safety,
— in the interests of air safety,

The approach adopted has the objective to improve the landscape and environment through beach nourishment using river dredged material.									4. Overview of the case									The project concerns the coastal area situated in the Western part of the Liguria Region. The study area stretches for about 1.5 km of littoral. The area is subject to erosion. The erosive process is favoured by the increasing urbanisation and by a general reduction of transported sediments, due to a series of causes such as the removal of material from the river bed. In the past, local administrations adopted measures of a rigid nature consisting of building emerged structures. The initiative aims to introduce soft interventions (beach nourishment and submerged groynes) as an alternative to the previous structures. The beach nourishment has been done using the dredged material from the Roja River, according with the provisions of the basin plan. The result was an environmental and landscape improvement of the coastal area. 									5. Context and Objectives									a) Context									The project involved the 4 municipalities located in the Western part of Liguria Region: Ventimiglia, Camporosso, Vallecrosia and Bordighera. The study area stretches for about 1.5 km of littoral. This coastal area, exposed to waves generated by south-west winds, was originally nourished by the Roja River sediments. The Roja River basin (872 km2) lies in the Liguria Region and in the French Maritime Alps. At the turn of the 20th century, the construction of flood control for the generation of electric energy in the French territory caused a general reduction in transported river sediments to the beaches. The erosive process has been also favoured by different reasons such as: the deployment of the railway along the coastline, the removal of material from the river bed and increasing urbanisation. In this stretch of coast, since the first decades of the 20th century, and in particular after the second World War, different protective measures were taken. Almost all the interventions on the coast were realsed with hard measures, in particular parallel breakwaters.									The municipality of Bordighera, to protect its tourist industry mainly based on bathing establishments, proposed measures to combat coastal erosion. The project, which was enlarged to the whole littoral, used a series of submerged, parallel breakwaters but because of landscape safeguarding reasons was not approved. Finally, in 1998, the Liguria Region enhanced a programme agreement between the interested local administrations (the region itself, the province of Imperia and the 4 municipalities) in order to jointly face the erosion problem.									b) Objectives									The main objective was to create a more efficient and durable form of coastal defence, able to face coastal erosion as well as to ameliorate the natural landscape. The approach aimed to replace the hard structures built in the past by soft interventions (beach nourishment and submerged groynes). 									6. Implementation of the ICZM Approach (i.e. management, tools, resources)									a) Project Management									Regional and local public authorities are the primary players. In 1998, the Liguria Region enhanced a programme agreement between the interested local administrations (the Region itself, the Province of Imperia and the following municipalities: Ventimiglia, Camporosso, Vallecrosia and Bordighera). At the same time, the Liguria Region allocated 400 million Lire (about €200,000) that, in addition to the co-financing of other local administrations (600 million Lire- €300,000), had to finance the cost of the overall project:																																bathymetry measurements, mapping biotic communities and sediments;													a preliminary project  including an Environmental Impact Assessment covering the whole physiographic unit of interest													the final project of a first round of interventions .																															The realisation of the project has been entrusted with a tender to the Studio Sirito di Savona (Civil Engineering). The realisation of the final project has been possible thanks to the financing by the Structural Funds,  Objective 2. The final project was organised in different rounds of interventions (2 for Ventimiglia, 2 for Camporosso, 2 for Vallecrosia, 3 for Bordighera and an additional 1 still in progress for Bordighera)									b) ICZM tools									The preliminary project consists in two different types of protection measures: 																																the removal of existing hard structures (parallel breakwaters and other artificial reef structures) through the construction of 13 large semi-submerged groynes using rocks of the previous structures. The distance between the groynes varies between 180-250 m and each groyne is placed side by side to two artificial submerged reefs (-1 m below the sea level). The intervention also included the extension of the final groyne of Campo S.Ampelio for about 40 m. the beach nourishment 2,100,000 m3 of dredged material from the Roja River.													The initiative has given the opportunity to link the protection measures of the coastline with the requirements of the Roja River Basin Plan that foresees the need to dredge the river bed, in order to restore the hydrological regime in different sectors of the basin. The dredged material of the Roja River has been used to nourish the beaches within the physiographic unit allowing a significant cost reduction of works. Because of that, a study concerning the river bed has been provided. Furthermore, since the dredging area is an EU Site of Community Importance, the Province of Imperia conducted an Environmental Impact Assessment of the interventions. After fluvial material dredging activities, re-naturalisation works of the river bed have been proposed and carried out in order to restore natural conditions.																															The final project, funded by the Structural Funds, Objective 2, has been articulated in a different batch of interventions (2 for Ventimiglia, 2 for Camporosso, 2 for Vallecrosia, 3 for Bordighera and an additional 1 still in progress for Bordighera). These interventions, starting from the most critical areas covered, at the end, the whole stretch of littoral. 									7. Cost and resources									The total cost of the project is €11 million. 									8. Effectiveness (i.e. were the foreseen goals/objectives of the work reached?)									The structures done have been extremely important for the environmental and landscape improvement of this coastal area, giving the opportunity to have again a quality beach and allowing local people to re-use this area. Moreover, the beach has been able to sustain the high energy storm events occurred over the past few years. On the other hand, the beach alone is not enough to give back a quality waterfront, characterised today by low profile architectural housing and abandoned agricultural areas. 									9. Success and Fail factors									The complexity of the project is due in particular to the necessity to organise and co-ordinate the activities carried out along the coastline with those undertaken in the river. The involvement of local authorities and their capacity to co-operate has been a successful element for the whole project. Two of the major problems encountered during the project have been the traffic caused by truck transport of materials from the river to the beach and fishermen’s protests due to some fluvial interventions.   									10.

Experiences that can be exchanged									Flood risk perception and the modes of risk communication were analysed to improve the knowledge-base of the locals and raise awareness and personal preparedness. 									4. Overview of the case									The perception of risk and participation methods in the flood-prone community St. Peter-Ording was surveyed.									5. Context and Objectives									a) Context									St. Peter-Ording is situated at the northern German North Sea coast in a flood-prone area. It is protected by dunes and dykes. It covers 2,825 ha which are protected by beach dunes (mainly in the north) and wide sandbanks, and partly by dykes. The hinterland is low-lying (0-2.5 m). About 4,000 permanent residents plus 3,200 temporary residents live in the community. The economy is based on tourism and local services. The greater part of the Wadden Sea and its coastal ecosystems are protected, three national parks along the total German coast cover most of the German Wadden Sea. Participatory activities have been in progress.									Schleswig-Holstein state authorities are responsible to manage flood protection based on the valid flood protection master plan in the area. The State Ministry of the Interior is responsible for the primary dykes, regional water boards are responsible for secondary dykes. A cross-sectoral advisory board is participating in strategic planning. Larger local planning projects require public participation in the course of the planning procedure. A period of 100 years for major storm surges defines the minimum safety standard. The last severe storm surge occurred in 1976. Tidal and wind effects act together when it comes to a storm flood. 									b) Objectives									The main objective was to analyse in detail the perception of storm flood risk in a North Sea community. This was to include the personal involvement of the locals that live in such flood-prone areas in flood defence planning. 									6. Implementation of the ICZM Approach (i.e. management, tools, resources)									a) Project Management									The Coastal Defence Division of the Schleswig-Holstein Ministry of the Interior organised the initiative together with scientists form the Institute of Geography of the University of Kiel. 									b) ICZM tools									The methods for doing this inventory in a comparable way in several countries were discussed at an international expert meeting at the beginning. Press-releases and explanatory notes were written to accompany the actual surveys. Experts were to answer a questionnaire that considered the evaluation of information and participation methods. From 12th to 22nd October 2003 the questionnaires were distributed in St.  Peter-Ording. 									Participation and integration were elements of the study. The analysis of the results leads to a list of recommendations to improve information and participation in coastal protection management. Results of other projects had been taken into account to discuss methods and questionnaires. The public questionnaire was designed as a postal mailing. Despite the risks that individual questions may not be filled out, and personal reactions could not be accounted for, mailing was chosen as the most efficient method due to its relatively low effort. A pre-requisite was that the questions are very clear and need no additional explanations. Households were chosen randomly (1/3 in the city centre, 1/3 close to dykes and dunes, 1/3 further away from the protected shore-line but all in flood-prone areas): letters were distributed personally. A pre-paid envelop for sending back the filled out documents was included in the mailings. An introductory letter accompanied the questionnaire and a press-release to local media was published some days ahead of the polls. Regional and local authorities were informed about the survey. 									Twelve questions about risk perception, nine about participation, and three demographic questions were to be answered, taking about 20 minutes. People had to mark their home area in a rough map (not depicting streets) as additional information. The poll was anonymous. A questionnaire ideally starts with a simple question to reduce barriers followed by “tougher” questions. The demographic questions at the end of the questionnaire do not require great attention anymore. Different types of questions were applied: open questions to be answered with a free text and closed types: a) identification-type (name a time, number, group, …), b) to select one from presented alternatives, c) multiple choice (one or more answers possible), d) ranking on a 4-scale ruler (not including “don''t know” and neutral), e) yes-no answers, and f) hybrid of selection-type (g) plus space for own remarks. Additional information such as recent and historical storm flood disasters in the area were included to evaluate the results. Additionally, experts from authorities, universities and research institutes, consultants, and stakeholders were asked (by e-mail) to answer 12 questions concerning the evaluation of information tools, experience with and evaluation of participation procedures. The questions were organised as multiple choice, ranking and open questions.									The survey results in St. Peter-Ording revealed that a majority of people were not prepared for a flood event and did not know how to react in such a case or how to get proper information, and about 20% were not aware that they lived in a flood-prone area. Correspondingly, only a small percentage of people had taken personal measures to be prepared for a storm flood. Almost no person had ever participated in a participatory process concerning coastal protection, though almost 50% wished to give their opinion. And, at least one participatory event had taken place. However, most people did not know how to accomplish that, and many people thought that the public had no influence anyway. A high percentage (42%) would like to be actively involved, 34% by participating in an information evening, 18% would even work regularly as a volunteer. The experts thought that information and participation tools are equally important but are still not commonly applied. The involvement of local press and participation procedures within planning approval procedures were seen as important instruments for participation but also inquiries, public hearings, working groups or workshops depending on the circumstances. Making coastal protection a topic at school was seen as an important information tool besides informing the press and offering excursions, many more tools were suggested. Most participation procedures were evaluated as a success for the acceptance of a coastal protection measure. Experts suggested to have external/ independent chairs and to involve the public earlier, so that a certain measure would be the output and not the input of a participation process. About 80% thought that participation may cause trouble for the involved administration (extra cost and time). Proper communication was assumed as a key aspect for information and participation. Coastal defence, disaster management and prevention should be dealt with as connected topics. The internet is seen as suitable additional information but not a participatory tool. 									7. Cost and resources									The total survey cost €503,000 of which 50% was financed by ERDF funds.									8. Effectiveness (i.e. were the foreseen goals/objectives of the work reached?)									32 recommendations to improve information and participation were developed from the results of the public and the expert survey. The return rate of the public questionnaires was in a range that is expected for a postal mail survey (21.3% of 400 questionnaires). The return rate of the expert questionnaires was very heterogeneous but relatively high (35%). The public survey revealed that a lack of proper information was prevalent and that most people trusted radio and television (29%), prevention or fire brigades (22%), and authorities (19%) to provide information on protective measures in case of a storm flood. Even experts seem to suffer from a lack of information. Maps seem to be misinterpreted by many people and thus not necessarily a suitable instrument to inform the general public. 									9. Success and Fail factors									No correlation between risk awareness and personal experience or demographic factors was found. However, people were at least partly aware of the fact that sea level rise influences flood risk. The study revealed a need for more and better information on flood risks and risk reduction. The expert survey revealed that a mixture of information and participation instruments should be applied depending on the circumstances. 									10. Unforeseen outcomes									The study revealed no correlation between risk awareness and personal experience or demographic factors, as had been assumed from the literature. It showed that knowledge alone does not necessarily lead to immediate understanding or action. Another unexpected result was that many people seem to have problems with reading maps. About half of the people were not interested to voice their opinion in a participatory process concerning coastal protection (though, the other half were). The internet has not been established itself as an information tool in this area. Instruments considered more innovative such as future workshops or citizen’s jury have not yet been accepted as valuable instruments by experts. Even many of the experts suffered from a lack of information on several topics. 									11. Prepared by									Priv.-Doz. Dr. habil.

Such layered structure is widely observed in the atmosphere and oceans. It governs the vertical transport of pollutants and chemical components and the dissipation of momentum. A critical problem is, for example, the thermal inversion in urban areas that causes the stagnation of pollutants and small particles in the lower part of the atmosphere. 
The main goal of this research is to investigate the linear and nonlinear evolution of the zig-zag instability in complex stratified flows as previous work has been restricted to prototype flows. This will improve the fundamental understanding of stratified turbulence, a crucial step towards developing accurate parametrization of stratified turbulence in numerical models of the atmosphere and oceans. 
The research will be carried out through theoretical and numerical studies and with new designed laboratory experiments and measurement techniques which may result in the development of patents with the collaboration of the European industry. 
 This project provides the opportunity to work on a highly interdisciplinary topic at an internationally renowned institution, the Laboratoire d''Hydrodynamique at Ecole Polytechnique, offering the possibility to translate research results into academic papers and patents, which can be used in both academic and practitioner contexts. Understanding the dynamics of stratified turbulence will be valuable to improve climate models and to support future predictions in forthcoming Intergovernmental Panel of Climate Change reports.

Overview of the case									Erosion was threatening a large number of holiday cottages built on top of a soft-rock cliff and the beach facilities adjacent to the cliff. A plan was devised to build up the beach and protect the cliff face using detached breakwaters behind which sand bars would form. The cost of the works was divided equally between the county, the municipality and the affected stakeholders.									5. Context and Objectives									a) Context									Liseleje-Hyllingebjerg is located along 2.8 km of the North Zealand (Sjaelland) coastline which consists of both large cliffs and shallow beaches in the Kattegat. The natural dynamics of the coast are characterized by a west-east directed sediment transport: the average erosion rate is ca. 1 m per year. This erosion is due to human interference, through local coastal protection measures and removal of large stones and boulders. Acute erosion due to heavy storm events also occurs. About 80 landowners are situated directly on the cliff tops and there are many summerhouses. The area is intensely used for recreation. 									Over the years, individual landowners and local coastal protection groups have built a variety of ad hoc slope protection structures consisting of concrete and timber piles, rubber tyres, rocks etc. A number of wooden groynes and non-integrated, small detached rock breakwaters, located in shallow water, were also built. These inadequately designed structures and a lack of maintenance have led to a deterioration of the slope protection structures and some of the existing detached breakwaters.									b) Objectives									The policy option for the coastal protection scheme is “Hold the line”. The beaches should be recovered and the summer cottages on the cliffs protected. The coastal protection should be based on technically sound solutions, e.g. rock slope protection to reduce wave reflection and thus beach retreat. The solutions should also be aesthetic, e.g. by making the slope protection more uniform and remove all deteriorated and unsightly structures.									6. Implementation of the ICZM Approach (i.e. management, tools, resources)									a) Management									The maintenance of the coastal protection system is in the hands of a coastal guild consisting of members from three groups of stakeholders viz.  the county, the municipality and stakeholders. Most of the landowners have agreed with the coastal protection measures and have been unified in a local association according to the Coastal Protection Act. This local board is responsible for the maintenance of the revetments and the county is responsible for the maintenance of the breakwaters and for sand nourishment.									b) ICZM tools									A Master Plan drawn up in 1989 recognised that the area Hyllingebjerg – Liseleje was in need of coastal protection. The purpose was to protect the summer cottages at the top of the cliff in an environmental friendly and visually acceptable way. In 1995, the Hyllingebjerg-Liseleje association conducted a private survey among the 80 landowners (summer cottages) to see whether they were interested in coastal protection (63% were positive and 15% were negative). They then asked the county of Frederiksborg to initiate the process according to the underpinning legislation, the Coast Protection Act.									In 1996, the coastal guild was set up and the public informed about the programme on the internet. An external consulting engineer was hired and in 1997 two alternative proposals were presented to the landowners at a public hearing. Based on this hearing the county decided to go ahead with one of the proposals. The following requirements were established:																																Protection of the summer cottages against slope erosion;													Preparation of an overall plan for the coastal protection;													Establishment of as much beach as possible and accessible to the public													Protection to be near maintenance free i.e. after major storms or every 10 to 20 years for structures and every 5 to 10 years for beach nourishment.													Uninterrupted access along the coast during normal weather conditions.																															The cost would be divided evenly between county, municipality and landowners (1/3 each). Not all the landowners accepted this and they filed a complaint to the Minister of Transport. An agreement was eventually reached and in February 1999 the works started and were completed in June 1999.									Six new breakwaters with lengths of 40 to 60 m were included in the final plan, together with two small existing detached breakwaters which needed to be strengthened. They were designed so that tombolos (sand bars) would develop behind them.  They are located in water depths ranging from 0.5 to 2.0 m. Granite stones for the breakwaters were shipped in from Sweden and supplemented by stones obtained from a local gravel pit. Material from removed structures was also used in the construction.									An initial nourishment with about 80,000 m3 of sand was included to fill up the beach to the new expected equilibrium profiles and to avoid significant erosion of the coastline between the breakwaters when sand is trapped behind the breakwater during the formation of the tombolos. The sand for the beach nourishment was pumped ashore through a fixed steel pipe. Beach nourishment will be necessary about every 5 years.									The existing damaged or unattractive slope protection was either replaced by a rubble mound slope or such a slope was placed in front to obtain an aesthetic appearance. Several types of slope protection were used.									7. Cost and resources									No cost figures are available.									8. Effectiveness (i.e. were the foreseen goals/objectives of the work reached?)									This coastal protection has now been functional for a number of years and is working well and has withstood two severe storms, one of which was the worst in the last 100 years. By 2001, large amounts of sand had accumulated behind the new, detached breakwaters and are forming large tombolos thus re-establishing the beach for recreational purposes. The beach surface in front of the cliffs has increased in width providing more effective protection for the cliffs. The summer cottages on the cliffs are no longer threatened by storms because of the wider beaches in front of the cliffs and the better slope protections that were constructed. Aerial photos are used to assess the performance of the coastal protection work. The construction of the new breakwaters is not expected to have a great impact downstream although this is largely because an existing breakwater already interrupts the longshore sediment transport. 									9. Success and Fail factors									The funding arrangement was seen as important: the cost of €1,700,000being shared between the three main parties involved. This type of payment system is, of course, dependent upon the wealth of the private stakeholders. The landowners organized themselves into a private organization to represent their interests. It was clear that it was important that the public always be fully informed about the process and have easy access to the information. In this case, the County of Frederiksborg used its website. 									10. Unforeseen outcomes									The large tombolos have resulted in limited sand accumulating in a few of the bays between the detached breakwaters which in turn have caused a retreat of the coastline locally. As a result, a few landowners are critical that they have not got an improvement locally.									11. Prepared by									A. H. Pickaver, Coastal &amp; Marine Union (EUCC), The Netherlands 									12. Verified by									It was not possible to verify this case.									13.

Overview of the case									A 1000 ha. island has been restored from centuries of use as agricultural farmland to a natural area for Nature and human visitors.									5. Context and Objectives									a) Context									Tiengemeten is a 1000 ha. island lying in the estuary of the Haringvliet estuary in the Dutch Rhine-Maas delta, just south of Rotterdam. Between 1705 and 2005, it was predominantly agricultural (700 ha.), with potato and beet crops surrounded by about 300 ha of reed and shrub vegetation.   After the disastrous floods of 1953, the Netherlands embarked on the construction of the Delta Works. Dykes were strengthened and storm barriers were built to keep the sea out. The land is now well protected against the threat of floods, but the tidal nature that was common in the south-west part of the Netherlands has almost disappeared. The same is true along the Haringvliet estuary. Before the Haringvliet was closed off from the open sea in 1970, there was a two-metre difference between high and low tide and the environment was saline. Since the closure, the tidal range has shrunk to 30 centimetres and there is now a freshwater environment. The number of types of fish in the Haringvliet has halved, from 95 to 49 species. This had serious consequences for the vegetation and fauna of the Haringvliet. The intertidal surface area with its characteristic mud flats and salt marshes shrank as the ecological gradients disappeared. Numbers of estuarine and marine species have declined dramatically. Migratory fish, such as shad, have all but disappeared. A few deccenia ago, there were plans for the island for a cargo airport, a power station and dumping of polluted ground. However, in 1990 the Dutch government decided to incorporate Tiengemeten in the Ecological Main Structure (EHS), the network of existing and new nature reserves in the Netherlands. Tiengemeten should become a natural area and the restoration of the tidal movements in the Haringvliet again became an important goal, part of a wider effort to restore the estuary. The restoration of the entire island of Tiengemeten to a natural state is the largest single project in the Haringvliet estuary so far. 									b) Objectives									The restoration project focused on the 700 ha. agricultural area of the island. The polders are being turned into a tidal landscape with creeks, reedlands, brushwood and tidal forests with tourist facilities for the visitors.									6. Implementation of the ICZM Approach (i.e. management, tools, resources)									a) Management									The work was commissioned by the Government Service for Land and Water Management (DLG) of the Dutch Ministry of Agriculture, Nature management and food quality. The island was acquired in 1997 by the Natuurmonumenten Association, a large Dutch nature conservation organisation. The major partners are Rijkswaterstaat (Directorate General for Public Works and Water Management), the municipality of Korendijk and the Province of South Holland.									b) ICZM tools									In October 2007, a large earth-mover created a 50 metre-wide gap in the dyke on the south side of the island of Tiengemeten in the province of South Holland. This undertaking was the last part of a large nature development project for a large part funded by the European Union. The break in the island’s defences gave tidal water a free run over a large area of the island. A wilderness is now developing, with areas of reed, brushwood and tidal forest with shallows and mudflats. Before Natuurmonumenten took over the management of the island there were still six tenant farmers working on Tiengemeten. All were offered alternative farms on the mainland. About three-quarters of a million tons of earth have been moved for the re-development, eighty buildings have been demolished and new inlets dug out. Around the three settlement areas, new quays have been constructed to protect them against flooding. The outside dyke has been strengthened, and others have been lowered or removed. Eleven kilometres of road have been removed and replaced by three kilometres of new roads. While 980 poplars have been felled, twice as many trees, mainly ash, have been planted. Natuurmonumenten is using a herd of Scottish Highlanders to graze a large part of the grassland on the island all year round. Although nature development is the priority, there is more to the project. 									The landscape has been developed and divided into areas with three distinct characters: wistfulness, wealth and wilderness. With over 600 hectares, the ‘Wilderness’ (Wildernis) area covers the largest part of the island. Here a natural, tidal landscape has emerged, governed by water and wind. ‘Wealth’ (Weelde) is the name of the rich, fertile area in the middle of the island. Covering over 300 hectares, part of it is inundated in the winter, drying up slowly in the course of the summer: a haven for waders. It will be a semi-natural landscape with grass, reed and swamp vegetation, mud flats that dry out and shallows. ‘Wistfulness’ (Weemoed) is the name of the oldest most easterly part of the island, which derives its character from the restoration of the cultural heritage in the landscape and covers 40 hectares. This area, called the Old Polder (Oude Polder), was the first to be enclosed by a dyke, in 1750. Visitors will be able to enjoy fields of herbs and flowers, orchards with old fruit tree varieties, an alder grove and rows of pollarded trees. Smaller dykes that have disappeared are being restored and the small fields will be biologically cultivated by traditional varieties of winter wheat and flax with a plough pulled by the Zeeuwse carthorse. The area includes the grasslands outside the dyke. 									The Haringvliet floodgates will be opened up gradually, allowing the tidal range to increase and more exchange of salt and fresh water. When the gates open up even further after 2010, the tidal range will increase to 60 cm and the ratio of salt to freshwater will increase. Tiengemeten will remain a fresh water tidal area, though. The salt sea water itself will not reach the islands’ tidal creek, but the tidal range will increase, improving the conditions for Wilderness to develop. For the visitor: There’s a visitors’ centre in one of the old barns on the waterfront in the harbour and another old farm has been converted  into a bed &amp; breakfast with a small ‘green’ campsite. New footpaths have been laid out, bird hides and observation posts have been built, and soon there will be a special area where children can play. Most of the eight farms along the northern dyke will be restored. A ninth farm and a workers’ cottage are right in the middle of the wilderness area, and they will be left to become ruins that will house owls and bats. Some houses on Tiengemeten will remain privately occupied and several houses and farms will also be converted into holiday accommodation. Two museums and premises for Natuurmonumenten are also planned. One of the farms will offer care services where residents, mainly people with mental health problems, can spend time helping with nature conservation activities and working in the heritage fields. In addition to houses and farms, the historical sluices are also being restored. 									7. Cost and resources									The purchase and re-development of Tiengemeten is budgeted at €37 m. For the nature development on the island a subsidy was obtained from the European LIFE fund, and the cultural heritage conservation work has made use of the European Interreg fund.									8. Effectiveness (i.e. were the foreseen goals/objectives of the work reached?)									The Haringvliet is a birds directive area. Tiengemeten has always had a rich bird population and numbers are expected to increase further. Already both osprey (Pandion haliaetus) and sea eagle (Haliaeetus albicilla) have been seen there. In the nature reserve outside the dyke, large numbers of songbirds are already nesting, including the bluethroat (Luscinia svecica). As the Haringvliet floodgates are gradually opened, fish such as allis shad, twaite shad, sea lamprey, salmon and sturgeon are expected to benefit.  Another species found here worth mentioning is the root vole (Microtus oeconomus) a sub-species found only in the Netherlands and a relict from the last ice age. It is the only Dutch mammal that is a priority species in the European Habitats Directive.									9. Success and Fail factors									Existing ecological features were preserved during the re-development of the island. Although the island receives many visitors, most of them walk along the northern dyke or climb an old refuge mound in the middle of the island. Much of the island is impassable for walkers so birds will be able to forage and breed in peace. The nature development was also done with an international twinning partner viz. the Conseil General de la Gironde (FR). 									10. Unforeseen outcomes									None so far.									11.

The decoupling challenge from the EU Sustainable Development Strategy implies that impacts of climate change on the river basin system should be diminished. This is a policy issue of contemporary urgency and it is a topic where large quantities of high quality knowledge (untapped potential) are available.
The consortium partners are all involved in different EU-projects with high relevance and have excellent contacts with relevant national research programs and easy access to national and regional policy makers. PSI-connect will experiment with and develop innovative knowledge brokering instruments in the field of impacts of climate change impacts on river systems. These instruments will be developed from available candidates such as Communities of Practice, games, group model building, and scenario workshops. We will develop and test these instruments in six case studies. Furthermore, knowledge brokerage communities will be established that act as learning communities and have the capacity to maintain European leadership in this field beyond the lifetime of the PSI-connect project itself.  Results will be disseminated to the relevant audiences through summer schools, a web-site and a final conference.

The climate impact of various transport modes (land surface, shipping, aviation) will be assessed, including those of long-lived greenhouse gases like CO2 and N2O, and in particular the effects of emissions of ozone precursors and particles, as well as of contrails and ship tracks. The project goal includes the provision of forecasts and other policy-relevant advice, which will be supplied to governments and to international assessments of climate change and ozone depletion, such as the IPCC reports (Kyoto Protocol) and WMO-UNEP ozone assessments (Montreal Protocol). Using significantly improved transport emission inventories, better evaluated and hence more reliable models, these new forecasts in QUANTIFY will represent a considerable improvement of current predictions. Long time scales are involved in the transport system and its effects on climate: Some transportation modes have long development and in-service times; some emissions have long residence times and the thermal inertia of the climate system is protracted. The impact of short-lived species, however, depends on location and time of the emissions.  So several transport scenarios and potential mitigation options need to be assessed on a sound common basis to identify the most effective combination of short and long-term measures and to inform policymakers and industry. We aim to provide such guidance by focused field measurements, exploitation of existing data, a range of numerical models, and new policy-relevant metrics of climate change. To achieve the goal, several advances in our fundamental understanding of atmospheric processes will be required such as the mechanisms by which pollutants are transported from exhaust into the free atmosphere, the impact of pollutants on clouds and the role of absorbing aerosols.

Building upon the experience of the previous INTERREG III C programme the partners will direct their actions to integrating climate change issues into regional policies and practices in order to deliver sustainable socio-economic development for the partner regions. The RSC project will address this issue by analysing current regional practices, developing benchmarks, criteria, and indicators for regions, as well as preparing a methodological handbook instructing regions how to integrate climate change issues into regional development plans, how to move towards low carbon economy and use the environment as an economic driver. The action will also offer partners the chance to carry out pilot actions, such as the preparation of a carbon footprint of regional development programmes. The project is expected to:
•Share good practices and develop long-lasting relationships between partners.
•Raise awareness and disseminate information via workshops, conferences and written materials.
•Inventory and compare approaches to strategic environmental assessment (SEA).
•Investigate and incorporate the use of SEA and sustainability assessments (SA) into regional development programmes.
•Prepare practical guidance to assist local and regional authorities and agencies across the EU to address climate change issues in regional development programmes. 
•Provide expertise and capacity building for partner regions.
•Give partner regions the opportunity to undertake pilot actions related to climate change.
•Communicate findings from the project at a strategic, policy-forming level. Awareness raising

It defines the main tasks, the priority programmes and cross-border cooperation required. The purpose is to promote balanced regional development in the fields of economy, spatial planning and social services. This should contribute to the reduction of development disparities in the region and contribute to the protection of the environment, natural and cultural heritage. It is suitable for any regional area in Europe seeking to sustainably develop its resources.									4. Overview of the case									A Conception of Spatial Development for South Primorska  has been drawn up to strengthen the sustainable spatial development of the region and to provide a strategic spatial context for priority investments for the period 2007-13. It is a framework for future spatial development of the region, providing guidance for the preparation of national and municipal spatial documents									5. Context and Objectives									a) Context									The region has ca. 80.000 coastal inhabitants. It is characterised by significant natural and cultural features and is economically successful with 70% of GDP from the service activities of trade, transport - the Port of Koper - and tourism). It is the only Slovenian region lying by the sea and although only 46 km long, the coastal zone is of enormous national value and it is of great strategic importance from economic, natural and cultural points of view. An over-arching spatial plan is required because of the conflicting interests in such a small coastal stretch.									The region is very attractive for various spatial investments. The main economic activity is tourism which has already led to conflicts between various land users due to the location of new activities. However, there has been under-investment in existing urban centres and larger settlements resulting in a decrease in the quality of life e.g. social stratification, environmental problems: noise, increased traffic congestion. Property in South Primorska is among the most expensive in Slovenia, its price rising constantly due to the demand for holiday homes. The road network is especially congested at the coast with some sections having 30,000 vehicles/day; parking represents a major problem in urban centres on the coast. The environmental impacts of car traffic are becoming increasingly evident. Public transport is poorly developed and is not an attractive alternative being  slow, uncomfortable and unreliable. The Port of Koper does not offer enough to the rest of Slovenia and abroad regarding the establishment of overseas economic links and trade flows. Sources of drinking water are relatively scarce and integrated planning of drinking water resources management is needed. Waste management is also not fully resolved and waste represents one of the largest pollution sources. Climate change also has had to be considered with sea level rise estimated at 1 mm/year. In the next hundred years, greater risk is expected with more frequent flooding of low-lying parts of coastal towns as there is poor flood prevention in some parts of the region.									b) Objectives									The key objectives of spatial development are to (1) establish a vision and concept of spatial development in the region, (2) formulate a regional concept of the distribution of selected spatial activities, (3) prepare spatial development guidelines to form the basis for strategic national and municipal planning documents; and (4) define measures for the implementation of the regional conception, taking into consideration the possibilities of co-operation with the neighbouring regions within Slovenia, within the EU (Italy), and with the regions in non-member countries (Croatia).									6. Implementation of the ICZM Approach (i.e. management, tools, resources)									a) Management									The Ministry of the Environment and Spatial Planning is responsible for overall co-ordination, management and supervision. A steering committee and advisory Board have been appointed and the work is carried out by a project co-ordinator within the Regional Development Centre Koper. 									b) ICZM tools									The vision of spatial development for South Primorska is to support sustainable welfare, equitable distribution and high quality of life, whilst protecting and strengthening natural, spatial and cultural goods. The strategy is based on the co-operation between the municipalities, the State and other partners, and on cross-border co-operation with partnerships between public and private sectors playing a key role. 									Spatial development will be based on a three-tier network of settlements designed to promote (i) intensive changes in strategically significant urban centres leading to increased competitiveness in the broader EU area, (ii) changes in more important local centres and settlements, and (iii) small-scale changes in other settlements. This will entail closer co-operation with cross-border cities e.g. Trieste. For the purposes of the development of economic activities, economic zones will be defined and adequately regulated. In addition to socio-economic conditions, spatial criteria will be taken into consideration in the development of transport and energy networks, the size of settlements, and spatial opportunities and limitations arising from the state or characteristics of the natural and cultural landscape. 									In line with the Strategy for Sustainable Tourism Development of South Primorska, the development objectives are to strengthen the sustainable character of tourism development. This will be done through integrated management of the destination and the improvement of the existing tourist products, services and investments in tourist accommodation and support infrastructure. This entails reducing the environmental impacts of tourist activities through a more even spatial distribution of (new) tourist capacities. 									A transport concept has been defined which will be based on the principles of sustainable mobility. Its objective is to establish an efficient and competitive system of public transport, while at the same time improving the accessibility of transport services for a wider circle of users e.g. cyclists. The measures within the spatial plan play a crucial role as locating activities wisely reduces or prevents the growth in mobility needs.									The Plan takes into account the water needs for the region as well as the regulation of discharge and treatment of urban wastewater. Future regional spatial development will ensure that the restrictions arising from water protection requirements are adequately compensated by various development incentives and various forms of compensation. It includes flood areas in certain rivers and sea floods on a narrow coastal strip as well as those areas subject to erosion.									7. Cost and resources									No costs are available.									8. Effectiveness (i.e. were the foreseen goals/objectives of the work reached?)									A vision, goals and a strategy of tourism development in the region have been defined. They have been harmonised with the principles of sustainable development and the environment carrying capacity as assessed on the basis of selected indicators. A programme of key measures has also been drawn up for the coming programming period and integrated into the Regional Development Programme for the period 2007–2013. The key expected result of the project has been a programme of coastal area management in Slovenia, serving as a basis for the implementation of priority activities and projects in the 2007-2013 programming period, in co-operation with the State, the Municipalities and other key actors in the South Primorska region.									9. Success and Fail factors									An assessment of Environmental Impacts of the Conception has been carried out. It will positively affect i.a. the sustainable use of natural resources, the improved status of surface and ground waters, improved access to social services. However, it may have a negative effect on industry through measures taken to reduce water loss, deterioration of the sea due to the foreseen increase in maritime transport and a threat of increased noise emissions resulting from the planned construction of traffic infrastructure. The work formed part of a Mediterranean Action Plan Coastal Area Management Programme.									10. Unforeseen outcomes									Spatial development patterns in the Slovene coastal area are significantly more sustainable compared to the described spatial development patterns in the broader Mediterranean context. Existing conflicts are solved at a higher administrative level. 									11. Prepared by									 A. H. Pickaver, Coastal &amp; Marine Union (EUCC), The Netherlands 									12.

Overview of the case									The Wadden Academy plays an agenda-setting, programmatic and information role for research in the Wadden Sea. The five areas of research are climate science, ecology, geology, economy and socio-cultural aspects. It is a compact, facilitating organisation with scientific authority.									5. Context and Objectives									a) Context									The Wadden Sea (Netherlands, Germany and Denmark) is the largest unbroken system of intertidal sand and mud-flats in the world, with natural processes undisturbed throughout most of the area. It encompasses a multitude of transitional zones between land, sea and freshwater environments and is rich in species especially adapted to the demanding environmental conditions. It is considered one of the most important global areas for migratory birds and is connected to a network of other key sites for migratory birds. Its importance is not only in the context of the East Atlantic Flyway but also in the critical role it plays in the conservation of African-Eurasian migratory waterbirds. In the Wadden Sea, up to 6.1 million birds can be present at the same time and an average of 10-12 million pass through it each year. Since 1978, The Netherlands, Denmark and Germany have been working together on the protection and conservation of the Wadden Sea covering management, monitoring and research, as well as political matters. In 2009, over 66% of the whole Wadden Sea was designated as a World Heritage Site. Alongside this ecological importance, the Wadden sea also has significant economic functions such as energy (gas and oil), minerals, recreation and fisheries. 									The Dutch government, in cooperation with the Province of Friesland, agreed in 2004 to found a single body, the Wadden Academy which would coordinate national research efforts in the Wadden Sea. It was founded and began its work in 2008.									b) Objectives									The goals of the Academy are threefold; identifying knowledge gaps with respect to sustainable development of the Wadden Sea and articulate responsive research questions; promoting integrated, regional, national and international research programmes; promoting information and knowledge exchange in, and between, government, the private sector and other societal organisations.									6. Implementation of the ICZM Approach (i.e. management, tools, resources)									a) Management									The Wadden Academy falls under the Royal Dutch Academy of Sciences (KNAW). It has five Board members named in 2008 which are supported both by a Bureau and Advisory Council. The Advisory Council is responsible for the social and scientific relevance of the activities of the Academy.									b) ICZM tools									The Wadden Academy came into being as a result of a government decision to set aside part of the Wadden Fund – a special fund to direct extra investments to the Wadden Sea region through projects - for the improvement of knowledge exchange about the area. The then Coastal Zone Management Centre was requested how this could best be done. In 2004, a report was published which showed that, although the accessibility of knowledge and information was very good, its utilisation could be greatly improved. This meant that the possibilities for human use were not being optimised, that many problems would start to arise as a result of the effects of climate change as well as through eutrophication and pollution and invasive, exotic species. Of particular concern was the lack of any co-ordination in the various research projects being conducted and the lack of any integration of the research projects being conducted. The conclusion was that an Academy would be the best way to solve these problems. Certain conditions were applied such as it should not itself conduct research nor duplicate work done elsewhere but fill in information and research programme gaps. It should also have a major role in involving societal organisations and stakeholders in discussions of the required research programme. It should also have an international dimension by involving non-Dutch researchers.									In November 2004, a number of Dutch academic institutes i.a. Groningen and Wageningen Universities took on initial responsibility for the development of the Academy. During the next three and a half years, there were intensive discussions held with relevant stakeholders and organisations about the most effective form of organisation for the Academy. A number of variants were put forward varying from a large research institute with an annual budget of at least €10m to a fully virtual institute. Eventually, the current model of a small, compact, knowledge-oriented organisation operating as a network and as part of the Royal Dutch Academy of Sciences was agreed.									The Academy has the ambition to develop into a centre of excellence with a broadly applicable, integrated, knowledge base concerning sustainable development of the coastal area where nature values are central and contributing to the local and region economy. It should be seen as a focal point for national and international scientists, managers, policy-makers and government administrators. Together, they are expected to come forward with sustainable and innovative solutions such that, in 2020, the Wadden Sea will be the best monitored and most understood coastal system in the world. 									A phased implementation plan has been drawn up and now implemented. Initially, there will be a period of consultation with, and feedback from, stakeholders e.g. a digital discussion platform via the website. Based upon the ideas put forward, an implementation plan of the various projects and programmes will be established. This will be done by multi-disciplinary teams facilitated and coordinated by the Academy. The third phase will be to seek financing for the agreed activities and the Academy hopes to secure more private funds than has hitherto been the case. The fourth phase, with the second half of 2010 as a goal, is to internationalise the work bringing together German and Danish scientific expertise as well as finances, also from the EU. From 2014, the fifth phase will begin which is an independent evaluation of the Academy.									7. Cost and resources									The Academy is financed by the Wadden Fund and the province Fryslân. The government has ear-marked €800m in a twenty year period for this fund. In 2009, €5m for a period of five years was granted by the Wadden Fund for the Academy out of €28m that was granted for projects in the Wadden Sea as a whole. The province Fryslân donated € 500.000 for the subsequent five years. 									8. Effectiveness (i.e. were the foreseen goals/objectives of the work reached?)									It is too soon to draw any conclusions. However, the Wadden Academy potentially offers a Wadden Expertise Centre. It has the possibility and the ambition of functioning as an international scientific knowledge centre oriented to providing public information on sustainability and nature conservation in the Wadden area as an international habitat. It should guarantee making an inventory of, and updating, relevant international knowledge and insights, safeguarding independent research and making the results available.									9. Success and Fail factors									The involvement of a broad, multi-disciplinary group of scientists which were requested to draw up a series of position papers which were used to set the agenda of the Academy was important.									10. Unforeseen outcomes									As  with many new ventures, the realisation of the Academy met with some initial opposition. Arguments were that research in the Wadden was already being done by various universities already; and that it would hinder, rather than help, research by introducing bureaucracy. The lack of Board members from the two Wadden provinces was a further criticism. It no longer plays a role. 									11. Prepared by									A. H.

Overview of the case									Design and implementation of detached submerged breakwaters and beach nourishment for the protection of a Greek coast (Paralia Katerinis). 									5. Context and Objectives									a) Context									The most acute environmental problem of Greek coastal areas is increasing beach erosion. The main reasons for the increasing beach erosion of the islands of the Greek Archipelago are: (1) sea level rise and the other climatic changes (extreme events and changes in the annual frequency of the winds), (2) the reduction of sediment supply from the hinterland of the islands due to the construction of dams and water reservoirs and (3) construction of ports and harbours. The above reasons, and especially the third one, results in a significant erosion (e.g. in the order of 30 m in Paralia Katerinis beach in Thermaikos Gulf, northern Greece). 									b) Objectives									Beach nourishment and construction of submerged breakwaters in Greece is almost an unknown procedure. Only a few beach nourishment cases in Greece have been reported while only ‘hard’ coastal structures are used for shore protection. The objectives of recent studies are to design and apply environmental friendly methods to tackle the severe problem of beach erosion in coastal areas. Also the case will be an example to help Greek coastal engineers in the functional design of such structures. 									6. Implementation of the ICZM Approach (i.e. management, tools, resources)									a) Management									A specialist team (senior coastal engineers and university staff members) has been established to study the beach erosion problem and to design appropriate protection schemes. The prefecture of Pieria and the Greek Ministry of Infrastructures finances and supervises the implementation of the work, i.e. construction of the breakwaters and beach nourishment. 									b) ICZM Tools									Advanced numerical models, developed by the research coastal engineering team have been used to study the erosion problem and to design the ‘soft’ shore protection methods.  By using the numerical models the simulation of waves, wave-induced currents and sediment transport processes has been obtained.  Firstly the models applied to understand the causes of erosion by simulating the existing conditions. The main cause of erosion was the construction of a fishing harbour.  Then, different cases have been applied, concerning the number of the breakwaters, the length of the breakwaters, the distance from the shoreline, the transmission coefficient, the free-board. The above applications led to the adoption of the final optimum solution. Experience gained in EU projects SAFE and DELOS were also used for the functional design.									7. Cost and resources									The study was funded by the Municipality of Paralia Katerinis (costing ca. €120.000). The construction works are funded by the Greek Ministry of Infrastructures (costing ca. €3.000.000). 									8. Effectiveness (i.e. were the foreseen goals/objectives of the work reached?)									The study and its implementation offer a new advanced and environmental-friendly approach to coastal protection in Greece.									9. Success and Fail factors									The project is under construction. 									10. Unforeseen outcomes									The main problem, raised during implementation was the source of the significant amount of sand to be used for beach nourishment. 									11. Prepared by									P.

* What causes climate changes and abrupt changes over the course of interglacial periods? 
* Can we understand the greenhouse gas records of the interglacial periods? 
* What can the past tell us about risks for climate changes/threats in the future? 
  The program will inform the international debate on climate system stability and the dissemination of results will be targeted to both citizens and governmental and non-governmental stakeholders. It will leave a legacy of improved understanding of past drivers of sea level changes, changes of sea ice, and of greenhouse gas concentrations, and it will train a new generation of young climate researchers to further advance research and improved future predictions for the benefit of society and our capacity to mitigate and adapt to climate changes.

The results can be used for evacuation plans and to develop long-term plans of integrated development. 									5. Context and Objectives									a) Context									The German North Sea coastal zone is characterized by the Wadden Sea (UNESCO world heritage, national parks, biosphere reserves) and islands. The economy is dominated by agriculture and tourism. Tourism may pose a growing pressure due to climate change. Global sea level rise due to climate change is estimated from several centimetres up to more than a meter within the next 100 years. For the design of dykes a sea level rise of 50 cm per 100 years is used to determine the design water level in Lower Saxony and Bremen. In the new Master Plan for Lower Saxony and Bremen from 2007, a sea level rise of 1 metre per 100 years is considered for the design of foundations of hard structures. The total protected flood prone area of Lower Saxony covers about 6,600 km2 and is inhabited by about 1.2 million people. 									The island of Langeoog is protected by dykes on the Wadden Sea side and by dune belts on the northern and western coast. The protected area (10.6 km length) covers 6.62 km2. About 2,000 people live on Langeoog and it is an important sea resort with a strong tourist economy. The dykes have a height of 5.4-8 metres above sea level. The mainland study side is bordered by the North Sea (north and west) and the river Ems and Sauter canal in the south. The Ems-Jade canal with high embankments divides the study area. The entire coastline is protected by dykes (109 km). The considered area covers 1292 km2 with 305,000 inhabitants. 									b) Objectives									The aim was to identify additional threats posed by climate change and to identify the threats according to various scenarios. New approaches were used for modelling flood risks and to assess probable damage affecting the area until the year 2100. Communication with local and regional stakeholders and the public was an integral part of the project. The work was carried out between July 2005 and June 2008. 									6. Implementation of the ICZM Approach (i.e. management, tools, resources)									a) Management									Lower Saxony Water Management, Coastal Defence and Nature Conservation Agency (NLWKN) carryied out the study. 									b) ICZM tools									Flood simulations were done depending of various flooding scenarios. Potential breach locations were defined to create flooding scenarios. Simulations were based on a 50 cm sea level rise per century, and carried out for the years 2007 (present), 2050 (25 cm), and 2100 (50 cm). Flood simulations were based on numerical hydro-dynamic models, enabling time-dependent flood propagation modelling. Stream networks, mostly drainage channels, were included in 1-D representation (for better spatial resolution). Lowlands are characterized by many drainage channels. They greatly influence flood propagation. Damage assessment was based on direct damage categories (private buildings and inventory, fixed assets, gross value), affected inhabitants, and the value of affected soil. The expected sea level rise increased the damage in all categories in the simulations. 									Recommendations were aimed at further foreland management to reduce hydraulic loads on dykes, maintenance of embankments in the hinterland, including second dyke lines, streets, dams, etc. as flood risk mitigation measures. However, such measures influence flow paths, therefore, areas that used to be safe may be flooded. And, if flooding occurs from an unexpected direction, the “wrong” area may be flooded and under higher danger than before. The results were discussed with local and regional experts and stakeholders. A local contact group was established to raise stakeholder and public awareness, and to get feedback to improve the recommendations as output of the project. 									7. Cost and resources									The detailed budget is not known but ERDF funding was used (50%). 									8. Effectiveness (i.e. were the foreseen goals/objectives of the work reached?)									The integration of the drainage channel system lead to a better representation of flood propagation. 									9. Success and Fail factors									The communication process with the public increased knowledge about climate change and flood risks. Applying several scenarios for simulations was a way to take into account  uncertainties. The prediction of future economical changes in flood prone areas and therefore the assets at risk are highly uncertain. Uncertainties are present in all parts of the risk analysis. Level of expertise and the related existing awareness on flood risks was very heterogeneous in the public. The demand for information on climate change and flood risks was high. 									10.

Overview of the case									The Camargue Regional Nature Park (PNR) started, in 2000, to elaborate a Delta Contract. Within this framework, this case has been concerned with coastal and marine aspects focusing on three themes: natural hazard management, sustainable management of aquatic resources and control of tourist numbers. Concerted actions were planned through numerous dialogue structures linked with the park and on public meetings which were devoted to the revision of the charter in every village. Simultaneously some studies were launched on the same three themes to improve and share the knowledge to complete the programme of actions in the best conditions. 									5. Context and Objectives									a) Context									The Camargue is the Rhône delta in the south of France. It is a wetland of international importance. Wholly surrounded by dykes, water output and input is artificially controlled according to the water needs of the various activities (especially rice-growing). Nature conservation plays a major role in the management of this territory using numerous conservation tools: 55% is designated for Nature. There are just 7,500 inhabitants but high numbers of visitors. Nonetheless, traditional activities also need to be kept as they contribute to the local heritage. However, natural hazards (marine flooding) are an important characteristic of this territory. For the last 15 years the Rhône delta has suffered many flood events, which had never occurred in nearly hundred years prior to this. Such disasters caused stakeholders to rally for better water management which might be conducted by the park although the possible solutions today to protect the coast against the sea are limited, a fact that obliges the different stakeholders to think together for new answers.									b) Objectives									Within the framework of the delta contract, the initiative aims to develop a coastal and marine programme of actions which favours wide consultation and relies on the shared knowledge as regards the three chosen themes.									6. Implementation of the ICZM Approach (i.e. management, tools, resources)									a) Management									The initiative was implemented by the “syndicat mixte” which manages the PNR. The steering process works through different governance structures which contribute to the park’s functioning and includes all the relevant stakeholders (park council and thematic commissions, “Commission exécutive de l’eau”, working groups of the Delta Contract).									b) ICZM Tools									The Delta Contract is a contractual document between partners which was used to initiate the approach. The work then relied on three tools:																																exchange and working meetings with institutional stakeholders (services of the local and State authorities),													public meetings in the villages of the Camargue, and													studies and expert’s reports concerning the themes to forward the discussion and improve the knowledge needed for a diagnosis.																															The three proposed themes were addressed in the following way:																																As regards the management of natural hazards, a strategic study was carried out to define the status of the sand coast conservation. Following definition of the management principles and cartography of the situation, the study gives scenarios of intervention in each sector.													As regards the aquatic resources, the work focused on the management of shellfish fishing.  An overall study was conducted to better know the volume and state of the resource. From this study a partnership was possible (e.g. representatives of professions, the civil service, IFREMER) allowing propositions of management and development. The Park published a technical document on these different points.													As regards the tourist numbers, the project focused on the Piémenson Beach where unauthorized camping has developed for several years. To put an end to this illegal activity, the French Government gave the Park a mandate of mediation. Several meetings occurred and a synthesis of previous studies and the legal situation was carried on to develop a management strategy.																															7. Cost and resources									The Park received funding of €60 000 which contributed to the different studies. Additionally, it was driven with the ordinary means of the Park (a representative in charge of the littoral”.									8. Effectiveness (i.e. were the foreseen goals/objectives of the work reached?)									Despite consultation, the scenario of hazard management which was agreed by all the partners in the Saintes-Maries-de-la-Mer sector was not finally applied by the State Services. With respect to controlling tourism, the work is at a standstill because of problems of land purchase even though  illegal occupancy continues.									9. Success and Fail factors									Thanks to its background history and missions, the Park was accepted in a mediating role. It is also used to this sort of consultation. The strong involvement of the maritime prefecture certainly contributed to the success of the “fishing” part of the project. However, the lack of well identified representatives of the State services for the other themes (erosion, tourism) and poor co-ordination of these services contributed to some blockages. Concerning some complex points with long-standing issues, if the process of consultation/mediation, which was conducted by the PNR, has allowed some progress, it was insufficient when the main institutional and political stakeholders were not strongly involved.  The approach was certainly positive to put in place and develop some partnerships for the future park charter as regards the themes “management of aquatic resource” and management of tourist numbers”.

The scientific work packages in SafeLand are organized in five Areas:
Area 1 focuses on improving the knowledge on triggering mechanisms, processes and thresholds, including climate-related and anthropogenic triggers, and on run-out models in landslide hazard assessment;
Area 2 does an harmonisation of quantitative risk assessment methodologies for different spatial scales, looking into uncertainties, vulnerability, landslide susceptibility, landslide frequency, and identifying hotspots in Europe with higher landslide hazard and risk;
Area 3 focuses on future climate change scenarios and changes in demography and infrastructure, resulting in the evolution of hazard and risk in Europe at selected hotspots;
Area 4 addresses the technical and practical issues related to monitoring and early warning for landslides, and identifies the best technologies available both in the context of hazard assessment and in the context of design of early warning systems;
Area 5 provides a toolbox of risk mitigation strategies and guidelines for choosing the most appropriate risk management strategy.
Maintaining the database of case studies, dissemination of the project results, and project management and coordination are defined in work packages 6, 7 and 8.  SafeLand will provide Member States with the means to contribute to the Soil Framework Directive, using well understood and commonly adopted risk assessment and management terminology and methodology and harmonised approaches and tools, and will have insight in the potential effects of global change (climatic and anthropogenic) scenarios.

Experiences that can be exchanged									Different and innovative techniques to protect the coastline and enhance both nature values and improve socio-economic well-being through augmenting tourism.									4. Overview of the case									In south west Netherlands, a 14 km stretch of coastline is being protected to allow for a flooding risk of once in 4000 years. The coast has been divided into five sections and different protection measures have been employed for each dependent upon the particular needs and uses of the coastline.									5. Context and Objectives									a) Context									In the Netherlands, coastal defences must legally be able to withstand one strong storm event every 4000 years. Ten weak points (zwakke schakels) have been identified which do not satisfy this requirement. Eight of them have been prioritised and two of these lie in Zeeland, one of which is a 14 km. stretch of coastline lying along the west coast of Zeeuws Vlaanderen, in the south west of the country. This means that these weak areas must be strengthened between now and 2020 in order to withstand the anticipated sea level rise due to climate change. The implementation of the whole programme began in 2007.									The work is not only aimed at strengthening the coast. It also addresses the spatial quality of the coaste.g. recreation, socio-economic activities (housing) and nature and, where possible, local entrepreneurial initiatives have been taken on board. The defence emphasis is now on ''soft'' solutions because more dunes equals more space for nature and recreation. The Zeeuws Vlaanderen coast has been divided into five separate sections and each is being approached differently, the defence method being used best fitting the particular characteristics of the area. The end result will be not only a safe shore but a attractive and viable coastal area where nature has the opportunity to develop.									b) Objectives									The West Zeeuws Vlaanderen coast needed to be strengthened by 2015 to meet the Dutch legal requirement.									6. Implementation of the ICZM Approach (i.e. management, tools, resources)									a) Management									The waterboard of Zeeuws Vlaanderen is the manager of the dykes and dunes and has responsibility for the strengthening of the dykes. Because of the size of the task, a project bureau called Weak Link Zeeuws Vlaanderen has been set up so that the different, involved  organisations work together to  strengthen the coast to area-specific requirements.									b) ICZM tools									The five areas of the coastline are (south to north):-									Cadzand: where sand will be used to strengthen seawards together with strengthening the jetties and the dam area west of a pumping station. It will strengthen the character of the town as a resort by broadening the sandy beach. The anticipated cost is €22 million.									Herdijkte Zwarte Polder: where most strengthening will be done seawards but in conjunction with the construction of a breakwater to prevent further silting of the Drowned Black Polder. These two polders are part of a larger Natura 2000 area and thus important nature areas. They are well-loved by walkers and the defence works will increase the dune area. The anticipated cost is €11 million.									Nieuwvliet-Groede: where there will be a full reinforcement with sand on the seaward side to a distance of 50m. New dunes 60m wide will also be created providing 13ha. additional protection alongside the existing dyke using 3 million m3 sand. Work is expected to be completed by December 2009. Special measures are being taken to protect one nationally protected plant (the sea holly): the top layer of sand containing the seeds of the plant will be collected and stored and re-laid on the newly fashioned dykes. The anticipated cost is €30 million.									Waterdunen: where new dunes will be created landwards. This area has been treated separately from the others in a more area-integrated approach. The quality of the landscape will be improved by the development of new salt marshes and mud flats and increasing tourism possibilities in the form of a camping site, hotel and vacation houses to give a socio-economic impulse. The anticipated cost is €42 million.									Breskens: a town and resort, where a traditional raising of the dyke, by 2 m., will be done as a deep shipping route prevents seawards expansion and the town prevents landwards protection. The dykes will also be widened slightly. It is hoped to pave the top of the dyke for walkers and cyclists. The anticipated cost is €24 million.									So far two environmental impact assessments (EIA) have been prepared, one for Waterdunen (in 2007) and the other for the rest of the coastline (in 2009). The initiatives have been accommodated in the area plan &quot;Natural Living&quot; for West Zeeuws Vlaanderen and by the national Flood Programme.									New, experimental methods of protection are also being designed for use. In the area Nieuwvliet-Groede, a so-called “Sand Engine” will provide a reservoir of ca. 200,000t of sand, in one place, being part of the 2.2 million m3 total sand required for suppletion. This innovative form of sand suppletion is being used for the first time. The idea is that the sand will be gradually eroded north-eastwards, naturally over a four to five year period carrying the eroded sand from this fixed point along the coastline to supplete those areas which would otherwise need to be suppleted mechanically. One advantage of this technique is that it can better protect the flora and fauna along the coast. It even has the potential to be used as a tourist attraction. All the sand is shipped from sites ca. 55km from the shoreline. 									The current planning is: 2009: Nieuwvliet-Groede, 2010: Herdijkte Zwarte Polder, 2011 - 2012: Waterdunen, 2013: Cadzand-Bad, 2014: Breskens									7. Cost and resources									€130 million has been estimated for the complete works. 									8. Effectiveness (i.e. were the foreseen goals/objectives of the work reached?)									So far the planning and implementation schedule is on target.									9. Success and Fail factors									Communication with all the involved partners had been the biggest challenge, in particular informing and involving the local inhabitants. This has been accomplished in a number of creative ways e.g. the students of one of the schools was requested to design a lookout tower. The EIA and cost benefit analysis were also both considered important tools. The design for Waterdunen was further inspired by the recreational and nature area of Marquenterre in northern France as well as the Schelde work at Lippenbroek and Kruibeke.									10. Unforeseen outcomes									None so far.									11. Prepared by									A. H. Pickaver, Coastal &amp; Marine Union (EUCC), The Netherlands 									12.

Context and Objectives									a) Context									The archipelago of the Azores, an autonomous region of Portugal, is located in the middle of the Atlantic Ocean, between Europe and North America. The nine islands comprising the archipelago are spread throughout an area of 66000 km2 along a NW-SE axis and grouped in three different clusters: the Central Group (Terceira, S. Jorge, Graciosa, Pico and Faial), the Eastern Group (S. Miguel and Santa Maria) and the Western Group (Flores and Corvo).Small islands (defined here as those with approximately 10,000km2 or less and approximately 5,000 or fewer residents) have special needs including new models of spatial planning that integrate land based activities with coastal planning.The Azorean coastal zone area represents a significant proportion of the territory of the archipelago (943 km coastal length for a total area of 2322 km2 total area).Santa Maria, Graciosa, Flores and Corvo are the smallest islands of the archipelago but ones with the highest ecological values. The climatic conditions linked to the geographic isolation, the relief and the geological characteristics of the islands have resulted in a great variety of biotopes, ecosystems and landscapes, which provide a high number of habitats for a huge variety of species.The geographical scale for implementation is local and regional, since the area considered consists of the coast (from 500 meters to -30 meters) of four islands of the archipelago.Some areas within the islands were already protected under legal demands, like Natura 2000 sites or Protected Areas, but with a lack of conservative management plans or effective implementation. 									b) Objectives									To develop and implement Coastal Zone Management Plans to four islands and promote a decision support methodology with the involvement of the local communities, while integrating ecological and socio-economic aspects. 									6. Implementation of the ICZM Approach (i.e. management, tools, resources)									a) Project Management									The Regional Government/Environmental Agency was the promoter of the CZMP in the archipelago. The responsibility for the plan was a multidisciplinary team, mainly from different Portuguese Universities and different institutes that were led by the University of the Azores. There was an accompanying commission that integrated different regional entities and representatives of different sectors (economic, environmental, social, and institutional) which had the responsibility of approving the plan. 									b) ICZM tools									CZMP in Portugal are legally binding for public and private entities and they establish the potential for land use. Compared with CZMP from the remaining islands of the archipelago with plans approved, there are some differences between the methodologies used. In the small islands it was possible to implement a new strategy of public involvement to participate in the decision process. 									A decision-support system, along with Strategic Environmental Assessment (SEA), should ensure that decision makers, technicians, administrative and political powers have an unbiased vision of the problems and solutions. Therefore, throughout the development of the Plans, a series of tools were used and applied, including GIS, alternative scenarios, modelling, SEA and proposals of integrating monitoring for the process of adaptive management.									The participation of local communities was promoted through forums available on internet and several public participation meetings that were scheduled. There was also an internet page developed to disseminate information to the public interested in the development of the plans.									The elaboration of these plans took about one and a half years until final approval. The implementation process is still under development and the revision of the plan should be undertaken 10 years after the approval date.									7. Cost and resources									The CZMP were financed by the Regional Government to a total of €478,250. The implementation cost, calculated by the CZMP team is approximately €53,000,000. Some of the measures that were defined, will be implemented by the municipalities or by local entities. 									8. Effectiveness (i.e. were the foreseen goals/objectives of the work reached?)									Establishing integrated CZMP strategies on small islands has the positive thinking of starting a process, initiating dialogue, stressing the need for a new style of governance, improving public participation on decision making and raising awareness for coastal problems.									The elaboration of CZMP was achieved but the implementation process is still on-going and not in the time schedule defined. 									Though spatial planning is the best instrument to address coastal problems in small islands, ICZM strategies are still needed.									9. Success and Fail factors									A good coordination between all the members of the team that elaborated the project. 									Closed systems tend to limit the number of actors with an impassioned point of view. Whenever an Integrated CZMP strategy is designed, it should start to design some kind of mechanism to ensure that the impacts of personal influences are minimized. The process of public participation was adequate though the public attendance in the meetings was low.									Another different approach was the integration of the strategic environmental evaluation. These were the first plans in Portugal that integrate Strategic Environmental Assessment.									Though most of them were solved, conflicts arose due to different political approaches between the plan promoter and the planning team or between different administrative levels, delaying the process of  decision-making and the establishment of intervention priorities. 									There wasn’t enough funding for implementation.									It is necessary to raise transparency on the process, making each citizen a guardian of the conduct of others and building the foundations of a partnership with all segments of society.									10. Unforeseen outcomes									The involvement of local communities led to a feeling of public responsibility towards the decisions. 									11.

Overview of the case									A strategic regional programme for south east England was set up to offer a standard, repeatable and cost-effective method of monitoring of the coastal environment. Previous monitoring had been isolated, ad hoc and not integrated. Such a monitoring system is vital for operational management of coastal protection and flood defence.  The programme has the capacity to fulfil both strategic needs and local management requirements.									5. Context and Objectives									a) Context									The south-east coast of England is characterised by low-lying land susceptible to both flooding and erosion as a result of rising sea levels and soft sedimentary geology. Various studies have highlighted the need for a more standard approach to coastal monitoring in order maximise the use of data and to provide best value. The historic approach to coastal monitoring has been both ad-hoc and unsatisfactory within the UK. Data collection and analysis methodologies have been inconsistent, and coordination has been poor. However, despite this, region-wide monitoring costs have been estimated to vary between £700,000 and £1.4m per year. Although several region-wide monitoring programmes have been managed in isolation, results have not been integrated; neither in context with each other, nor with relation to regional aspects of shoreline management; this is contrary to best practice shoreline management principles. The South-East Strategic Regional Coastal Monitoring Programme (SRCMP) was introduced as a means of providing a standard, repeatable and cost-effective method of monitoring the coastal environment. It provides information for development of strategic shoreline management plans, coastal defence strategies and operational management of coastal protection and flood defence.									b) Objectives									The objectives are to promote a standard, repeatable and cost-effective method of monitoring of the coastal environment and to promote, inform and integrate operational monitoring requirements. This has entailed i.a. an examination of the range of types of data collected within the coastal zone on both defended and undefended coasts and a determination of whether any further types of data should be collected which might benefit the understanding and management of the coastal zone.									6. Implementation of the ICZM Approach (i.e. management, tools, resources)									a) Management									DEFRA is the government department responsible for coastal defence legislation and funding. A specialist team has been established at the Channel Coastal Observatory within the National Oceanography Centre, Southampton, to manage the monitoring programme and develop the data analysis, storage and dissemination procedures. 									b) ICZM tools									Local Authorities, the Coastal Groups of the southeast of England and the Environment Agency are working with a collective vision to develop a long-term, region-wide coastal process monitoring and analysis programme. The South-East SRCMP covers approximately 1000km of coastline. Although there were a number of extremely good local monitoring programmes in place in areas such as Bournemouth, North Kent and Christchurch Bay, it was identified that a region-wide approach was necessary offering a standard and repeatable means of coastal monitoring. The Environment Agency Annual Beach Management Survey (ABMS), an annual aerial survey programme generating beach profiles by photogrammetry, over 440km of coast, was, prior to the SRCMP, the most comprehensive regional monitoring programme. The South-East SRCMP encompassed the older ABMS programme along with an extensive Geographical Positioning System (GPS) survey schedule and wave and tidal data. Data is collected via a series of contracts and also by in-house local authority teams.									A risk-based design approach was adopted for the regional programme in order to optimise expenditure. Ideally, regular surveys of the various variables should be conducted at consistent (dense) spatial and (frequent) temporal scales. This approach cannot be sustained or justified financially however, and a reasoned method of sampling was designed to provide best value for money. The risk categories considered in programme design are:																																Exposure to wave attack													Vulnerability to flooding													Management strategy													Coastal geomorphology and geology													Defence type																															Each of the risk categories was considered separately, before drawing the data together within a weighted risk model. Illustrations of this risk-based approach are as follows:																																Exposed sites with active beach management and vulnerable features and a shingle beach require frequent and intensive monitoring e.g. Medmerry (Sussex).													Low exposure, hard-cliff sites, with a do-nothing strategy need less intensive coverage e.g. Beachy Head (Sussex), but some strategic data is needed to support other down-drift sites within the process unit e.g. Eastbourne (Sussex).													Bathymetric surveys may be needed annually in areas of low tidal range and active submerged sediments e.g. Bournemouth (Dorset), whilst areas that have a beach toe that dries at low water on a hard rock platform will not benefit from frequent bathymetric surveys e.g. Hythe (Kent).																															Each site was reviewed on the basis of exposure and the general dynamics of the local system.									The survey programme consists of a number of different survey techniques including both land-based and bathymetric surveys. In addition, the programme also undertakes airborne photography and remote sensing topographic surveys (using lidar). Ortho-photography is also used for habitat mapping. The programme came into being on 1 August 2002 and the first phase extended to March 2007. The second phase is underway and is funded until 31 March 2012, with the expectation that the programme will continue indefinitely. 									7. Cost and resources									The programme is funded by DEFRA and the programme is costing approx £1.5m per year.									8. Effectiveness (i.e. were the foreseen goals/objectives of the work reached?)									The South-East SRCMP offers a standard and repeatable approach to coastal monitoring which has been lacking in the past. Although the programme is still in its early stages there have already been significant advances made in data collection and management as a result of the programme. All data collected by the SRCMP and results from the analysis programme are made freely available via the Programme''s website.									9. Success and Fail factors									Continuous funding has been important for the success of the programme. One of the strengths of the programme is that it is led by a Local Authority. It is quite unusual in the UK for Local Authorities to run such extensive programmes on behalf of others but this has been of huge benefit since it makes sure that local needs don''t get neglected by a region-wide, strategic programme.  So it''s a &quot;bottom-up&quot; approach, scaled up to provide regional consistency and economy of scale. It is also the first programme to make all its data and analysis freely available.									10. Unforeseen outcomes									The first phase of the programme acted as a regional pilot model that was later used for a similar programme in the south-west of England, which came into being on 1 April 2006. The data is useful to Local Authorities within the region, the Environment Agency, consultants in coastal defence, conservation management, academic research and for educational purposes. Links are established with research communities to provide opportunities for value-added research programmes and in support of strategic research programmes.									11. Prepared by									A. H.

Overview of the case									The case study describes methods and planning instruments that have been used by Ventspils city, at the municipal level, to develop the town whilst preserving valuable natural resources. This entails optimally satisfying the interests of all parties involved (different stakeholders and institutions, including developers and environmentalists as well as the general public), as well as ensuring economic growth and the meeting of social needs e.g recreation. Ventspils has been able to prevent conflicts and solve potential problems before conflict arises. 									5. Context and Objectives									a) Context									Ventspils is the sixth largest city in Latvia situated in the north-west on the Baltic Sea at the outlet of the River Venta. The total area of the city is 55km2, with 44,000 inhabitants (2006). It is an important transport hub with an ice free deep-water port which has one of the largest cargo turn-overs in the Baltic region. At the same time Ventspils is a green city – almost half of the total area (45%) of the city is covered by natural flora that consists mainly of pine forests (one quarter of the natural area). The River Venta, with a length within the city borders of 3.75 m and a width between 150-300m, divides the town. The total length of coastline in Ventspils city is 11.85km and is characterised by the beach and a dune zone along the shore reaching a maximum height of 15-20m. The beach used for recreation is a 300m wide and 1.2km long section of the seashore, situated to the south of the territory of the Free Port of Ventspils. Almost a quarter of the city’s administrative territory is occupied by the Free Port.									b) Objectives									Planning for the development of economic activities in a free port area while at the same time preserving valuable natural resources, minimising environmental pollution and facilitating beach recreation. 									6. Implementation of the ICZM Approach (i.e. management, tools, resources)									a) Management									At a national level, the Marine Environmental Board implements the state policy in marine environmental protection, sea coast development and use of sea natural resources under the Ministry of the Environment which co-ordinates implementation of the National Environmental Policy Plan. Ventspils City Council is responsible for planning and policy implementation of the city and those areas impacted by the city and its inhabitants.									b) ICZM tools									Ventspils City Council has used a wide variety of instruments to effect integrated management of the coastline. The over-arching policy is the Environmental Policy Plan and its action programme. This Plan is used by the city as a flexible environmental management tool, which allows it to promptly make informed decisions on effective solutions for various environmental problems and to ensure continuous monitoring of the implementation of the environmental action programme. The plan facilitates negotiations with large companies encouraging them to be more active in the development or improvement of their environmental management systems, further reduction of the risk of accidents and reduction of pollution. The plan also provides for the dissemination of more comprehensive information to the public on the environmental status of the city and encourages greater public involvement in decision-making on environmental issues. It is under-scored by the National Environmental Policy Plan which defines environmental protection principles and the main goals and measures for their achievement. Special attention is paid to the integration of the Environmental Policy in all industries of the Latvian national economy, as well as at the level of national, regional and local planning. Ventspils city has developed, from its Environmental Policy Plan, a Development Strategy for 2005-2015									In 2004, Latvia introduced the Strategic Environmental Assessment (SEA) in compliance with the requirements of the EC SEA Directive. A strategic assessment was applied to the city Planning Document (2006-2018) which reflects the long-term development trends of the municipality, determining the current and the planned use of the area, as well as prospective research areas (construction of the northern port), for which opportunities of use will be researched in the future. In addition, the planning document defines the protective belts and also envisages development of infrastructure e.g. a centralised water supply and sewerage network.  It included  the planning document to change the width of the Baltic Sea protective belts in the south-western part of Ventspils. It determined that to maintain the structure of the established and fore-dunes, changes would be needed for visitors e.g. no-go areas, walkways, designated recreation areas.									Environmental Impact Assessments (EIAs) are another tool which have been carried out for a number of reconstructions in the largest oil and product terminals in the port territory, as well as for the construction of a number of new production facilities and a sewage water treatment plant. In cases where, according to the law, an EIA is not required, the Ventspils Regional Environmental Board has been carrying out initial EIAs, and only thereafter technical requirements for design and construction works are being issued. 									Ventspils has also relied on good co-operation with the Free Port of Ventspils Authority. This authority provides various kinds of environmentally important services including the removal and the utilisation of different types of waste that are polluted with oil and oil products, the removal and purification of polluted waters from the washing of cargo tanks, and the removal of polluted ballast waters. In the case of oil or oil product spillage, it is possible to contain the spillage with absorbent booms within 15 minutes after which the polluted water area can be closed off with effective light booms and  the oil skimmed. The River Venta is the only maritime access to the port of Ventspils and must be regularly dredged as a minimum depth for sea going vessels has to be guaranteed. The Port Authority disposes 305.000 m3 annually in a special dumping area situated 4 nautical miles from the northern breakwater and 1.7 nautical miles from the shore line.									Ventspils has also found that participation in the Blue Flag movement is another good method for promotion of beach management and environmental education. The city government decided to get involved in the Blue Flag movement in 1997 and each year since 1999, the Blue Flag has been awarded for the beach, showing not only the development of bathing places and cleanliness of bathing waters but also a systematic and purposeful approach to solving environmental issues at local government level.									7. Cost and resources									No figures are available.									8. Effectiveness (i.e. were the foreseen goals/objectives of the work reached?)									The management methods chosen were geared towards preventing conflict before it needed to be resolved. They encouraged elaboration of an integrated strategy for the coastal area and the sustainable development of the whole town thereby facilitating the best possible decision-making. They have transformed the city and environs from an ecologically disadvantaged area to a well-kept and environmentally conscious city.									9. Success and Fail factors									Ventspils City Council have implemented a wide range of different tools as well as involving all interest groups viz. municipal and local institutions, developers, enterprises, NGOs, independent consulting companies and scientists.  It also co-operates with neighbouring, coastal, local governments because the environmental policy and management system cover not only the city territory but also all those areas around the city, which are of interest to and impacted by Ventspils and its inhabitants.									10.

An interdisciplinary writing team of Lead Authors was selected
by the three IPCC Working Group Bureaus with the aim of
achieving a regional and topical balance. Like all IPCC Technical
Papers, this product too is based on the material of previously
approved/accepted/adopted IPCC reports and underwent a
simultaneous expert and Government review, followed by a
final Government review. The Bureau of the IPCC acted in the
capacity of an editorial board to ensure that the review comments
were adequately addressed by the Lead Authors in the finalisation
of the Technical Paper.
The Bureau met in its 37th Session in Budapest in April 2008
and considered the major comments received during the final
Government review. In the light of its observations and requests,
the Lead Authors finalised the Technical Paper, after which the
Bureau authorised its release to the public.

Executive Summary

Executive Summary
Observational records and climate projections provide abundant evidence that freshwater resources
are vulnerable and have the potential to be strongly impacted by climate change, with wide-ranging
consequences for human societies and ecosystems.
1 See Box 1.1.
2 Numbers inside square brackets relate to sections in the main body of the Technical Paper.
3 Projections considered are based on the range of non-mitigation scenarios developed by the IPCC Special Report on Emissions Scenarios
(SRES).
4 This statement excludes changes in non-climatic factors, such as irrigation.
5 These projections are based on an ensemble of climate models using the mid-range SRES A1B non-mitigation emissions scenario. Consideration
of the range of climate responses across SRES scenarios in the mid-21st century suggests that this conclusion is applicable across a wider range
of scenarios.
Observed warming over several decades has been linked
to changes in the large-scale hydrological cycle such as:
increasing atmospheric water vapour content; changing
precipitation patterns, intensity and extremes; reduced snow
cover and widespread melting of ice; and changes in soil
moisture and runoff. Precipitation changes show substantial
spatial and inter-decadal variability. Over the 20th century,
precipitation has mostly increased over land in high northern
latitudes, while decreases have dominated from 10°S to 30°N
since the 1970s. The frequency of heavy precipitation events (or
proportion of total rainfall from heavy falls) has increased over
most areas (likely1). Globally, the area of land classified as very
dry has more than doubled since the 1970s (likely). There have
been significant decreases in water storage in mountain glaciers
and Northern Hemisphere snow cover. Shifts in the amplitude
and timing of runoff in glacier- and snowmelt-fed rivers, and in
ice-related phenomena in rivers and lakes, have been observed
(high confidence). [2.12]
Climate model simulations for the 21st century are consistent
in projecting precipitation increases in high latitudes (very
likely) and parts of the tropics, and decreases in some subtropical
and lower mid-latitude regions (likely). Outside
these areas, the sign and magnitude of projected changes
varies between models, leading to substantial uncertainty
in precipitation projections.3 Thus projections of future
precipitation changes are more robust for some regions than for
others. Projections become less consistent between models as
spatial scales decrease. [2.3.1]
By the middle of the 21st century, annual average river runoff
and water availability are projected to increase as a result of
climate change4 at high latitudes and in some wet tropical
areas, and decrease over some dry regions at mid-latitudes
and in the dry tropics.5 Many semi-arid and arid areas (e.g., the
Mediterranean Basin, western USA, southern Africa and northeastern
Brazil) are particularly exposed to the impacts of climate
change and are projected to suffer a decrease of water resources
due to climate change (high confidence). [2.3.6]
Increased precipitation intensity and variability are
projected to increase the risks of flooding and drought
in many areas. The frequency of heavy precipitation events
(or proportion of total rainfall from heavy falls) will be very
likely to increase over most areas during the 21st century, with
consequences for the risk of rain-generated floods. At the same
time, the proportion of land surface in extreme drought at any
one time is projected to increase (likely), in addition to a tendency
for drying in continental interiors during summer, especially in
the sub-tropics, low and mid-latitudes. [2.3.1, 3.2.1]
Water supplies stored in glaciers and snow cover are
projected to decline in the course of the century, thus
reducing water availability during warm and dry periods
(through a seasonal shift in streamflow, an increase in the
ratio of winter to annual flows, and reductions in low flows) in
regions supplied by melt water from major mountain ranges,
where more than one-sixth of the world’s population currently
live (high confidence). [2.1.2, 2.3.2, 2.3.6]
Higher water temperatures and changes in extremes,
including floods and droughts, are projected to affect water
quality and exacerbate many forms of water pollution –
from sediments, nutrients, dissolved organic carbon, pathogens,
pesticides and salt, as well as thermal pollution, with possible
negative impacts on ecosystems, human health, and water system
reliability and operating costs (high confidence). In addition,
sea-level rise is projected to extend areas of salinisation of
groundwater and estuaries, resulting in a decrease of freshwater
availability for humans and ecosystems in coastal areas.
[3.2.1.4, 4.4.3]
Globally, the negative impacts of future climate change on
freshwater systems are expected to outweigh the benefits
(high confidence). By the 2050s, the area of land subject to
increasing water stress due to climate change is projected to
be more than double that with decreasing water stress. Areas
in which runoff is projected to decline face a clear reduction in
the value of the services provided by water resources. Increased
annual runoff in some areas is projected to lead to increased
total water supply. However, in many regions, this benefit is
likely to be counterbalanced by the negative effects of increased
precipitation variability and seasonal runoff shifts in water
supply, water quality and flood risks (high confidence). [3.2.5]
Changes in water quantity and quality due to climate change
are expected to affect food availability, stability, access and
utilisation. This is expected to lead to decreased food security and
increased vulnerability of poor rural farmers, especially in the arid
and semi-arid tropics and Asian and African megadeltas. [4.2]
Executive Summary
Climate change affects the function and operation of
existing water infrastructure – including hydropower,
structural flood defences, drainage and irrigation systems
– as well as water management practices. Adverse effects
of climate change on freshwater systems aggravate the
impacts of other stresses, such as population growth, changing
economic activity, land-use change and urbanisation (very high
confidence). Globally, water demand will grow in the coming
decades, primarily due to population growth and increasing
affluence; regionally, large changes in irrigation water demand
as a result of climate change are expected (high confidence).
[1.3, 4.4, 4.5, 4.6]
Current water management practices may not be robust
enough to cope with the impacts of climate change on water
supply reliability, flood risk, health, agriculture, energy and
aquatic ecosystems. In many locations, water management
cannot satisfactorily cope even with current climate variability,
so that large flood and drought damages occur. As a first step,
improved incorporation of information about current climate
variability into water-related management would assist
adaptation to longer-term climate change impacts. Climatic and
non-climatic factors, such as growth of population and damage
potential, would exacerbate problems in the future (very high
confidence). [3.3]
Climate change challenges the traditional assumption
that past hydrological experience provides a good guide to
future conditions. The consequences of climate change may
alter the reliability of current water management systems and
water-related infrastructure. While quantitative projections of
changes in precipitation, river flows and water levels at the
river-basin scale are uncertain, it is very likely that hydrological
characteristics will change in the future. Adaptation procedures
and risk management practices that incorporate projected
hydrological changes with related uncertainties are being
developed in some countries and regions. [3.3]
Adaptation options designed to ensure water supply
during average and drought conditions require integrated
demand-side as well as supply-side strategies. The former
improve water-use efficiency, e.g., by recycling water. An
expanded use of economic incentives, including metering and
pricing, to encourage water conservation and development of
water markets and implementation of virtual water trade, holds
considerable promise for water savings and the reallocation of
water to highly valued uses. Supply-side strategies generally
involve increases in storage capacity, abstraction from water
courses, and water transfers. Integrated water resources
management provides an important framework to achieve
adaptation measures across socio-economic, environmental and
administrative systems. To be effective, integrated approaches
must occur at the appropriate scales. [3.3]
Mitigation measures can reduce the magnitude of impacts
of global warming on water resources, in turn reducing
adaptation needs. However, they can have considerable
negative side effects, such as increased water requirements
for afforestation/reforestation activities or bio-energy crops,
if projects are not sustainably located, designed and managed.
On the other hand, water management policy measures,
e.g., hydrodams, can influence greenhouse gas emissions.
Hydrodams are a source of renewable energy. Nevertheless, they
produce greenhouse gas emissions themselves. The magnitude
of these emissions depends on specific circumstance and mode
of operation. [Section 6]
Water resources management clearly impacts on many
other policy areas, e.g., energy, health, food security and nature
conservation. Thus, the appraisal of adaptation and mitigation
options needs to be conducted across multiple water-dependent
sectors. Low-income countries and regions are likely to remain
vulnerable over the medium term, with fewer options than highincome
countries for adapting to climate change. Therefore,
adaptation strategies should be designed in the context of
development, environment and health policies. [Section 7]
Several gaps in knowledge exist in terms of observations
and research needs related to climate change and water.
Observational data and data access are prerequisites for adaptive
management, yet many observational networks are shrinking.
There is a need to improve understanding and modelling of
climate changes related to the hydrological cycle at scales
relevant to decision making. Information about the waterrelated
impacts of climate change is inadequate – especially with
respect to water quality, aquatic ecosystems and groundwater
– including their socio-economic dimensions. Finally, current
tools to facilitate integrated appraisals of adaptation and
mitigation options across multiple water-dependent sectors are
inadequate. [Section 8]

6 ‘Scoping Paper for a possible Technical Paper on Climate Change and Water’. Available at: http://www.ipcc.ch/meetings/session21.htm.
1.1 Background
1.2 Scope
The idea of a special IPCC publication dedicated to water
and climate change dates back to the 19th IPCC Session held
in Geneva in April 2002, when the Secretariat of the World
Climate Programme – Water and the International Steering
Committee of the Dialogue on Water and Climate requested
that the IPCC prepare a Special Report on Water and Climate.
A consultative meeting on Climate Change and Water held in
Geneva in November 2002 concluded that the development of
such a report in 2005 or 2006 would have little value, as it would
quickly be superseded by the Fourth Assessment Report (AR4),
which was planned for completion in 2007. Instead, the meeting
recommended the preparation of a Technical Paper on Climate
Change and Water that would be based primarily on AR4 but
would also include material from earlier IPCC publications.
An interdisciplinary writing team was selected by the three
IPCC Working Group Bureaux with the aim of achieving
regional and topical balance, and with multiple relevant
disciplines being represented. United Nations (UN) agencies,
non-governmental organisations (NGOs) and representatives
from relevant stakeholder communities, including the private
sector, have been involved in the preparation of this Technical
Paper and the associated review process.
IPCC guidelines require that Technical Papers are derived
from:
(a) the text of IPCC Assessment Reports and Special Reports
and the portions of material in cited studies that were relied
upon in these reports;
(b) relevant models with their assumptions, and scenarios
based on socio-economic assumptions, as they were used
to provide information in those IPCC Reports.
These guidelines are adhered to in this Technical Paper.
these induces a change in another. Anthropogenic climate change
adds a major pressure to nations that are already confronting the
issue of sustainable freshwater use. The challenges related to
freshwater are: having too much water, having too little water,
and having too much pollution. Each of these problems may be
exacerbated by climate change. Freshwater-related issues play a
pivotal role among the key regional and sectoral vulnerabilities.
Therefore, the relationship between climate change and
freshwater resources is of primary concern and interest.
So far, water resource issues have not been adequately addressed
in climate change analyses and climate policy formulations.
Likewise, in most cases, climate change problems have not been
adequately dealt with in water resources analyses, management
and policy formulation. According to many experts, water and
its availability and quality will be the main pressures on, and
issues for, societies and the environment under climate change;
hence it is necessary to improve our understanding of the
problems involved.
The objectives of this Technical Paper, as set out in IPCC-XXI
– Doc. 96, are summarised below:
to improve our understanding of the links between both
natural and anthropogenically induced climate change, its
impacts, and adaptation and mitigation response options,
on the one hand, and water-related issues, on the other;
to inform policymakers and stakeholders about the
implications of climate change and climate change response
options for water resources, as well as the implications for
water resources of various climate change scenarios and
climate change response options, including associated
synergies and trade-offs.
The scope of this Technical Paper, as outlined in IPCCXXI
– Doc. 9, is to evaluate the impacts of climate change
on hydrological processes and regimes, and on freshwater
resources – their availability, quality, uses and management.
The Technical Paper takes into account current and projected
regional key vulnerabilities and prospects for adaptation.
The Technical Paper is addressed primarily to policymakers
engaged in all areas relevant to freshwater resource management,
climate change, strategic studies, spatial planning and socioeconomic
development. However, it is also addressed to the
scientific community working in the area of water and climate
change, and to a broader audience, including NGOs and the
media.
Since material on water and climate change is scattered
throughout the IPCC’s Fourth Assessment and Synthesis Reports,
it is useful to have a compact and integrated publication focused
on water and climate change. The present Technical Paper also
refers to earlier IPCC Assessment and Special Reports, where
necessary. The added value of this Technical Paper lies in the
distillation, prioritisation, synthesis and interpretation of those
materials.

This Technical Paper deals only with freshwater. Sea-level rise
is dealt with only insofar as it can lead to impacts on freshwater
in the coastal zone; for example, salinisation of groundwater.
Reflecting the focus of the literature, it deals mainly with climate
change through the 21st century whilst recognising that, even if
greenhouse gas concentrations were to be stabilised, warming
and sea-level rise would continue for centuries. [WGI SPM]
The importance of freshwater to our life support system is
widely recognised, as can be seen clearly in the international
context (e.g., Agenda 21, World Water Fora, the Millennium
Ecosystem Assessment and the World Water Development
Report). Freshwater is indispensable for all forms of life and
is needed, in large quantities, in almost all human activities.
Climate, freshwater, biophysical and socio-economic systems
are interconnected in complex ways, so a change in any one of

1.3 The context of the Technical Paper:
socio-economic and environmental
conditions
Text in the Technical Paper carefully follows the text of the
underlying IPCC Reports. It reflects the balance and objectivity
of those Reports and, where the text differs, this is with the
purpose of supporting and/or explaining further the Reports’
conclusions. Every substantive paragraph is sourced back to an
IPCC Report. The source is provided within square brackets,
generally at the end of the paragraph (except where parts of
a paragraph are sourced from more than one IPCC document,
in which case the relevant IPCC source is located after the
appropriate entry). The following conventions have been used.
The Fourth Assessment Report (AR4) is the most frequently
cited IPCC publication and is represented by, for example,
[WGII 3.5], which refers to AR4 Working Group II Chapter
3 Section 3.5. See IPCC (2007a, b, c, d).
Where material is taken from other IPCC sources, the
following acronyms are used: TAR (Third Assessment
Report: IPCC 2001a, b, c), RICC (Special Report on
Regional Impacts of Climate Change: Watson et al., 1997),
LULUCF (Special Report on Land Use, Land-Use Change
and Forestry: IPCC, 2000), SRES (Special Report on
Emissions Scenarios: Nakićenović and Swart, 2000), CCB
(Technical Paper V – Climate Change and Biodiversity:
Gitay et al., 2002) and CCS (Special Report on Carbon
Dioxide Capture and Storage: Metz et al., 2005). Thus,
[WGII TAR 5.8.3] refers to Section 5.8.3 of Chapter 5 in
the Working Group II Third Assessment Report.
Additional sourcing acronyms include ES (Executive
Summary), SPM (Summary for Policymakers), TS
(Technical Summary) and SYR (Synthesis Report), which
all refer to the AR4 unless otherwise indicated.
References to original sources (journals, books and reports) are
placed after the relevant sentence, within round brackets.

diet), economic policy (including water pricing), technology,
lifestyle7 and society’s views about the value of freshwater
ecosystems. In order to assess the relationship between climate
change and freshwater, it is necessary to consider how freshwater
has been, and will be, affected by changes in these non-climatic
drivers. [WGII 3.3.2]
1.3.1 Observed changes
In global-scale assessments, basins are defined as being waterstressed8
if they have either a per capita water availability
below 1,000 m3 per year (based on long-term average runoff)
or a ratio of withdrawals to long-term average annual runoff
above 0.4. A water volume of 1,000 m3 per capita per year is
typically more than is required for domestic, industrial and
agricultural water uses. Such water-stressed basins are located
in northern Africa, the Mediterranean region, the Middle East,
the Near East, southern Asia, northern China, Australia, the
USA, Mexico, north-eastern Brazil and the west coast of South
America (Figure 1.1). The estimates for the population living
in such water-stressed basins range between 1.4 billion and
2.1 billion (Vörösmarty et al., 2000; Alcamo et al., 2003a, b;
Oki et al., 2003; Arnell, 2004). [WGII 3.2]
Water use, in particular that for irrigation, generally increases
with temperature and decreases with precipitation; however,
there is no evidence for a climate-related long-term trend of
water use in the past. This is due, in part, to the fact that water
use is mainly driven by non-climatic factors, and is also due to
the poor quality of water-use data in general, and of time-series
data in particular. [WGII 3.2]
Water availability from surface water sources or shallow
groundwater wells depends on the seasonality and interannual
variability of streamflow, and a secured water supply is determined
by seasonal low flows. In snow-dominated basins, higher
temperatures lead to reduced streamflow and thus decreased
water supply in summer (Barnett et al., 2005). [WGII 3.2]
In water-stressed areas, people and ecosystems are particularly
vulnerable to decreasing and more variable precipitation due to
climate change. Examples are given in Section 5.
In most countries, except for a few industrialised nations, water
use has increased over recent decades, due to population and
economic growth, changes in lifestyle, and expanded water
supply systems, with irrigation water use being by far the most
important cause. Irrigation accounts for about 70% of total water
withdrawals worldwide and for more than 90% of consumptive
water use (i.e., the water volume that is not available for reuse
downstream). [WGII 3.2] Irrigation generates about 40%
of total agricultural output (Fischer et al., 2006). The area of
global irrigated land has increased approximately linearly since
This Technical Paper explores the relationships between climate
change and freshwater, as set out in IPCC Assessment and
Special Reports. These relationships do not exist in isolation,
but in the context of, and interacting with, socio-economic and
environmental conditions. In this section, we describe the major
features of these conditions as they relate to freshwater, both
observed and projected.
Many non-climatic drivers affect freshwater resources at all
scales, including the global scale (UN, 2003). Water resources,
both in terms of quantity and quality, are critically influenced
by human activity, including agriculture and land-use change,
construction and management of reservoirs, pollutant emissions,
and water and wastewater treatment. Water use is linked primarily
to changes in population, food consumption (including type of
Section 1 Introduction to climate change and water

stress map based on WaterGAP (Alcamo et al., 2003a). See text for relation to climate change. [WGII Figure 3.2]
1960, at a rate of roughly 2% per annum, from 140 million ha in
1961/63 to 270 million ha in 1997/99, representing about 18%
of today’s total cultivated land (Bruinsma, 2003).
Although the rates of regional population change differ widely
from the global average, the rate of global population increase is
already declining. Global water use is probably increasing due
to economic growth in developing countries, but there are no
reliable data with respect to the rate of increase. [WGII 3.2, 5.3]
The quality of surface water and groundwater has generally
declined in recent decades due principally to growth in
agricultural and industrial activities (UN, 2006). To counter
this problem, many countries (e.g., in the European Union and
Canada) have established or enforced effluent water standards
and have rehabilitated wastewater treatment facilities (GEO-3,
2003). [WGII 3.3.2, Table 8.1]
1.3.2 Projected changes
1.3.2.1 General background
The four IPCC SRES (Special Report on Emissions Scenarios:
Nakićenović and Swart, 2000) storylines, which form the
basis for many studies of projected climate change and water
resources, consider a range of plausible changes in population
and economic activity over the 21st century (see Figure 1.2).
Among the scenarios that assume a world economy dominated
by global trade and alliances (A1 and B1), global population
is expected to increase from today’s 6.6 billion and peak at
8.7 billion in 2050, while in the scenarios with less globalisation
and co-operation (A2 and B2), global population is expected to
increase until 2100, reaching 10.4 billion (B2) and 15 billion
(A2) by the end of the century. In general, all SRES scenarios
depict a society that is more affluent than today, with world gross
domestic product (GDP) rising to 10–26 times today’s levels
by 2100. A narrowing of income differences between world
regions is assumed in all SRES scenarios – with technology
representing a driving force as important as demographic
change and economic development. [SRES SPM]
1.3.2.2 Water resources
Of particular interest for projections of water resources,
with or without climate change, are possible changes in dam
construction and decommissioning, water supply infrastructure,
wastewater treatment and reuse, desalination, pollutant
emissions and land use, particularly with regard to irrigation.
Irrespective of climate change, new dams are expected to be
built in developing countries for hydropower generation as
well as water supply, even though their number is likely to be
small compared to the existing 45,000 large dams. However,
the impacts of a possible future increase in hydropower demand
have not been taken into account (World Commission on Dams,

storylines (based on Nakićenović and Swart, 2000).
[WGII Figure 2.5]
Regional emphasis

Global integration
2000; Scudder, 2005). In developed countries, the number of
dams is very likely to remain stable, and some dams will be
decommissioned. With increased temporal runoff variability
due to climate change, increased water storage behind dams
may be beneficial, especially where annual runoff does not
decrease significantly. Consideration of environmental flow
requirements may lead to further modification of reservoir
operations so that the human use of water resources might be
restricted. Efforts to reach the Millennium Development Goals
(MDGs, see Table 7.1) should lead to improved water sources
and sanitation. In the future, wastewater reuse and desalination
will possibly become important sources of water supply in semiarid
and arid regions. However, there are unresolved concerns
regarding their environmental impacts, including those related
to the high energy use of desalination. Other options, such
as effective water pricing policies and cost-effective water
demand management strategies, need to be considered first.
[WGII 3.3.2, 3.4.1, 3.7]
An increase in wastewater treatment in both developed and
developing countries is expected in the future, but point-source
discharges of nutrients, heavy metals and organic substances
are likely to increase in developing countries. In both developed
and developing countries, emissions of organic micro-pollutants
(e.g., endocrine substances) to surface waters and groundwater
may increase, given that the production and consumption of
chemicals, with the exception of a few highly toxic substances,
is likely to increase. Several of these pollutants are not removed
by current wastewater treatment technology. Modifications of
water quality may be caused by the impact of sea-level rise on
storm-water drainage operations and sewage disposal in coastal
areas. [WGII 3.2.2, 3.4.4]
Diffuse emissions of nutrients and pesticides from agriculture
are likely to continue to be important in developed countries
and are very likely to increase in developing countries, thus
critically affecting water quality. According to the four scenarios
of the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment (2005a) (‘Global
orchestration’, ‘Order from strength’, ‘Adapting mosaic’ and
‘TechnoGarden’), global nitrogen fertiliser use will reach 110–
140 Mt by 2050, compared with 90 Mt in 2000. Under three of
the scenarios, there is an increase in nitrogen transport in rivers
by 2050, while under the ‘TechnoGarden’ scenario (similar to
the IPCC SRES scenario B1) there is a reduction (Millennium
Ecosystem Assessment, 2005b). [WGII 3.3.2]
Among the most important drivers of water use are population
and economic development, but also changing societal views
on the value of water. The latter refers to the prioritisation of
domestic and industrial water supply over irrigation water
supply and the efficient use of water, including the extended
application of water-saving technologies and water pricing.
In all four Millennium Ecosystem Assessment scenarios, per
capita domestic water use in 2050 is broadly similar in all world
regions, at around 100 m3/yr, i.e., the European average in 2000
(Millennium Ecosystem Assessment, 2005b). [WGII 3.3.2]
The dominant non-climate-change-related drivers of future
irrigation water use are: the extent of irrigated area, crop
type, cropping intensity and irrigation water-use efficiency.
According to FAO (UN Food and Agriculture Organization)
projections, developing countries, with 75% of the global
irrigated area, are likely to expand their irrigated areas by 0.6%
per year until 2030, while the cropping intensity of irrigated
land is projected to increase from 1.27 to 1.41 crops per year and
irrigation water-use efficiency will increase slightly (Bruinsma,
2003). These estimates exclude climate change, which is
not expected by Bruinsma to affect agriculture before 2030.
Most of the expansion is projected to occur in already waterstressed
areas such as southern Asia, northern China, the Near
East and northern Africa. However, a much smaller expansion
of irrigated area is assumed under all four scenarios of the
Millennium Ecosystem Assessment, with global growth rates of
only 0–0.18% per year until 2050. After 2050, the irrigated area
is assumed to stabilise or slightly decline under all scenarios
except ‘Global orchestration’ (similar to the IPCC SRES A1
scenario) (Millennium Ecosystem Assessment, 2005a). In
another study, using a revised A2 population scenario and FAO
long-term projections, increases in global irrigated land of over
40% by 2080 are projected to occur mainly in southern Asia,
Africa and Latin America, corresponding to an average increase
of 0.4% per year (Fischer et al., 2006). [WGII 3.3.2]

1.4 Outline
Box 1.1: Uncertainties in current knowledge: their treatment in the Technical Paper [SYR]
The IPCC Uncertainty Guidance Note9 defines a framework for the treatment of uncertainties across all Working Groups
and in this Technical Paper. This framework is broad because the Working Groups assess material from different disciplines
and cover a diversity of approaches to the treatment of uncertainty drawn from the literature. The nature of data, indicators
and analyses used in the natural sciences is generally different from that used in assessing technology development or in
the social sciences. WGI focuses on the former, WGIII on the latter, and WGII covers aspects of both.
Three different approaches are used to describe uncertainties, each with a distinct form of language. Choices among and
within these three approaches depend on both the nature of the information available and the authors’ expert judgement
of the correctness and completeness of current scientific understanding.
Where uncertainty is assessed qualitatively, it is characterised by providing a relative sense of the amount and quality
of evidence (that is, information from theory, observations or models, indicating whether a belief or proposition is true or
valid) and the degree of agreement (that is, the level of concurrence in the literature on a particular finding). This approach
is used by WGIII through a series of self-explanatory terms such as: high agreement, much evidence; high agreement,
medium evidence; medium agreement, medium evidence; etc.
Where uncertainty is assessed more quantitatively using expert judgement of the correctness of the underlying data,
models or analyses, then the following scale of confidence levels is used to express the assessed chance of a finding
being correct: very high confidence at least 9 out of 10; high confidence about 8 out of 10; medium confidence about 5 out
of 10; low confidence about 2 out of 10; and very low confidence less than 1 out of 10.
Where uncertainty in specific outcomes is assessed using expert judgement and statistical analysis of a body of evidence
(e.g., observations or model results), then the following likelihood ranges are used to express the assessed probability of
occurrence: virtually certain >99%; extremely likely >95%; very likely >90%; likely >66%; more likely than not >50%; about
as likely as not 33% to 66%; unlikely <33%; very unlikely <10%; extremely unlikely <5%; exceptionally unlikely <1%.
WGII has used a combination of confidence and likelihood assessments, and WGI has predominantly used likelihood
assessments.
This Technical Paper follows the uncertainty assessment of the underlying Working Groups. Where synthesised findings
are based on information from more than one Working Group, the description of uncertainty used is consistent with that
for the components drawn from the respective Reports.
9 See http://www.ipcc.ch/meetings/ar4-workshops-express-meetings/uncertainty-guidance-note.pdf.
This Technical Paper consists of eight sections. Following the
introduction to the Paper (Section 1), Section 2 is based primarily
on the assessments of Working Group I, and looks at the science
of climate change, both observed and projected, as it relates to
hydrological variables. Section 3 presents a general overview of
observed and projected water-related impacts of climate change,
and possible adaptation strategies, drawn principally from the
Working Group II assessments. Section 4 then looks at systems
and sectors in detail, and Section 5 takes a regional approach.
Section 6, based on Working Group III assessments, covers waterrelated
aspects of mitigation. Section 7 looks at the implications
for policy and sustainable development, followed by the final
section (Section 8) on gaps in knowledge and suggestions for
future work. The Technical Paper uses the standard uncertainty
language of the Fourth Assessment (see Box 1.1).

iiiiiiirelate to water
Water is involved in all components of the climate system
(atmosphere, hydrosphere, cryosphere, land surface and
biosphere). Therefore, climate change affects water through a
number of mechanisms. This section discusses observations of
recent changes in water-related variables, and projections of
future changes.
and subsequent latent heat release above the surface. Hence,
absorbing aerosols may locally reduce evaporation and
precipitation. Many aerosol processes are omitted or included
in somewhat simple ways in climate models, and the local
magnitude of their effects on precipitation is in some cases
poorly known. Despite the above uncertainties, a number
of statements can be made on the attribution of observed
hydrological changes, and these are included in the discussion
of individual variables in this section, based on the assessments
in AR4. [WGI 3.3, 7.5.2, 8.2.1, 8.2.5, 9.5.4; WGII 3.1, 3.2]
2.1.1 Precipitation (including extremes) and
water vapour
Trends in land precipitation have been analysed using a number
of data sets; notably the Global Historical Climatology Network
(GHCN: Peterson and Vose, 1997), but also the Precipitation
Reconstruction over Land (PREC/L: Chen et al., 2002), the
Global Precipitation Climatology Project (GPCP: Adler et al.,
2003), the Global Precipitation Climatology Centre (GPCC:
Beck et al., 2005) and the Climatic Research Unit (CRU:
Mitchell and Jones, 2005). Precipitation over land generally
increased over the 20th century between 30°N and 85°N,
but notable decreases have occurred in the past 30–40 years
from 10°S to 30°N (Figure 2.1). Salinity decreases in the
North Atlantic and south of 25°S suggest similar precipitation
changes over the ocean. From 10°N to 30°N, precipitation
increased markedly from 1900 to the 1950s, but declined after
about 1970. There are no strong hemispheric-scale trends over
Southern Hemisphere extra-tropical land masses. At the time
of writing, the attribution of changes in global precipitation is
uncertain, since precipitation is strongly influenced by largescale
patterns of natural variability. [WGI 3.3.2.1]
The linear trend for the global average from GHCN during
1901–2005 is statistically insignificant (Figure 2.2). None of
the trend estimates for 1951–2005 are significant, with many
discrepancies between data sets, demonstrating the difficulty
of monitoring a quantity such as precipitation, which has large
variability in both space and time. Global changes are not linear
in time, showing significant decadal variability, with a relatively
wet period from the 1950s to the 1970s, followed by a decline
in precipitation. Global averages are dominated by tropical and
sub-tropical precipitation. [WGI 3.3.2.1]
Spatial patterns of trends in annual precipitation are shown in
Figure 2.3, using GHCN station data interpolated to a 5° × 5°
latitude/longitude grid. Over much of North America and
Eurasia, annual precipitation has increased during the 105 years
from 1901, consistent with Figure 2.1. The period since 1979
shows a more complex pattern, with regional drying evident
(e.g., south-west North America). Over most of Eurasia, the
number of grid-boxes showing increases in precipitation is
greater than the number showing decreases, for both periods.
There is a tendency for inverse variations between northern
Europe and the Mediterranean, associated with changes in the
North Atlantic Oscillation teleconnection (see also Section
2.1.7). [WGI 3.3.2.2]
The hydrological cycle is intimately linked with changes in
atmospheric temperature and radiation balance. Warming of
the climate system in recent decades is unequivocal, as is now
evident from observations of increases in global average air
and ocean temperatures, widespread melting of snow and ice,
and rising global sea level. Net anthropogenic radiative forcing
of the climate is estimated to be positive (warming effect),
with a best estimate of 1.6 Wm−2 for 2005 (relative to 1750
pre-industrial values). The best-estimate linear trend in global
surface temperature from 1906 to 2005 is a warming of 0.74°C
(likely range 0.56 to 0.92°C), with a more rapid warming trend
over the past 50 years. New analyses show warming rates in
the lower- and mid-troposphere that are similar to rates at the
surface. Attribution studies show that most of the observed
increase in global temperatures since the mid-20th century
is very likely due to the observed increase in anthropogenic
greenhouse gas concentrations. At the continental scale, it is
likely that there has been significant anthropogenic warming
over the past 50 years averaged over each of the continents
except Antarctica. For widespread regions, cold days, cold
nights and frost have become less frequent, while hot days, hot
nights and heatwaves have become more frequent over the past
50 years. [WGI SPM]
Climate warming observed over the past several decades is
consistently associated with changes in a number of components
of the hydrological cycle and hydrological systems such
as: changing precipitation patterns, intensity and extremes;
widespread melting of snow and ice; increasing atmospheric
water vapour; increasing evaporation; and changes in soil
moisture and runoff. There is significant natural variability – on
interannual to decadal time-scales – in all components of the
hydrological cycle, often masking long-term trends. There is
still substantial uncertainty in trends of hydrological variables
because of large regional differences, and because of limitations
in the spatial and temporal coverage of monitoring networks
(Huntington, 2006). At present, documenting interannual
variations and trends in precipitation over the oceans remains
a challenge. [WGI 3.3]
Understanding and attribution of observed changes also presents
a challenge. For hydrological variables such as runoff, nonclimate-
related factors may play an important role locally (e.g.,
changes in extraction). The climate response to forcing agents
is also complex. For example, one effect of absorbing aerosols
(e.g., black carbon) is to intercept heat in the aerosol layer
which would otherwise reach the surface, driving evaporation
16
Observed and projected changes in climate as they relate to water Section 2
The largest negative trends since 1901 in annual precipitation
are observed over western Africa and the Sahel (see also Section
5.1), although there were downward trends in many other parts
of Africa, and in south Asia. Since 1979, precipitation has
increased in the Sahel region and in other parts of tropical Africa,
related in part to variations associated with teleconnection
patterns (see also Section 2.1.7). Over much of north-western
India the 1901–2005 period shows increases of more than 20%
per century`, but the same area shows a strong decrease in
annual precipitation since 1979. North-western Australia shows
areas with moderate to strong increases in annual precipitation
over both periods. Conditions have become wetter over northwest
Australia, but there has been a marked downward trend in
the far south-west, characterised by a downward shift around
1975. [WGI 3.3.2.2]
A number of model studies suggest that changes in radiative
forcing (from combined anthropogenic, volcanic and solar
sources) have played a part in observed trends in mean
precipitation. However, climate models appear to underestimate
the variance of land mean precipitation compared to
observational estimates. It is not clear whether this discrepancy
results from an underestimated response to shortwave forcing,
underestimated internal climate variability, observational errors,
or some combination of these. Theoretical considerations
suggest that the influence of increasing greenhouse gases on
mean precipitation may be difficult to detect. [WGI 9.5.4]
Widespread increases in heavy precipitation events (e.g., above
the 95th percentile) have been observed, even in places where
total amounts have decreased. These increases are associated
with increased atmospheric water vapour and are consistent with
observed warming (Figure 2.4). However, rainfall statistics are
dominated by interannual to decadal-scale variations, and trend
estimates are spatially incoherent (e.g., Peterson et al., 2002;
Griffiths et al., 2003; Herath and Ratnayake, 2004). Moreover,
only a few regions have data series of sufficient quality and
length to assess trends in extremes reliably. Statistically
significant increases in the occurrence of heavy precipitation
have been observed across Europe and North America (Klein
Tank and Können, 2003; Kunkel et al., 2003; Groisman et al.,
2004; Haylock and Goodess, 2004). Seasonality of changes
varies with location: increases are strongest in the warm season
in the USA, while in Europe changes were most notable in the
cool season (Groisman et al., 2004; Haylock and Goodess,
2004). Further discussion of regional changes is presented in
Section 5. [WGI 3.8.2.2]
Theoretical and climate model studies suggest that, in a climate
that is warming due to increasing greenhouse gases, a greater
increase is expected in extreme precipitation, as compared to
the mean. Hence, anthropogenic influence may be easier to
detect in extreme precipitation than in the mean. This is because
extreme precipitation is controlled by the availability of water
vapour, while mean precipitation is controlled by the ability of
the atmosphere to radiate long-wave energy (released as latent
heat by condensation) to space, and the latter is restricted by
increasing greenhouse gases. Taken together, the observational

CRU data sets. [WGI Figure 3.12]
Across South America, increasingly wet conditions have been
observed over the Amazon Basin and south-eastern South
America, including Patagonia, while negative trends in annual
precipitation have been observed over Chile and parts of the
western coast of the continent. Variations over Amazonia,
Central America and western North America are suggestive of
latitudinal changes in monsoon features. [WGI 3.3.2.2]
17
Section 2 Observed and projected changes in climate as they relate to water
and modelling studies lead to an overall conclusion that an
increase in the frequency of heavy precipitation events (or in
the proportion of total rainfall from heavy falls) is likely to have
occurred over most land areas over the late 20th century, and
that this trend is more likely than not to include an anthropogenic
contribution. The magnitude of the anthropogenic contribution
cannot be assessed at this stage. [WGI SPM, 9.5.4, 10.3.6,
FAQ10.1]
There is observational evidence for an increase in intense
tropical cyclone activity in the North Atlantic since about 1970,
correlated with increases in tropical sea surface temperatures
(SSTs). There are also suggestions of increased intense tropical
cyclone activity in some other regions, but in these regions
concerns over data quality are greater. Multi-decadal variability
and the quality of the tropical cyclone records prior to routine
satellite observations in about 1970 complicate the detection of

long-term trends in tropical cyclone activity. There is no clear
trend in the annual numbers of tropical cyclones. Anthropogenic
factors have more likely than not contributed to observed
increases in intense tropical cyclone activity. However, the
apparent increase in the proportion of very intense storms since
1970 in some regions is much larger than simulated by current
models for that period. [WGI SPM]
The water vapour content of the troposphere has been observed
to increase in recent decades, consistent with observed warming

and near-constant relative humidity. Total column water vapour
has increased over the global oceans by 1.2 ± 0.3% per decade
from 1988 to 2004, in a pattern consistent with changes in sea
surface temperature. Many studies show increases in nearsurface
atmospheric moisture, but there are regional differences
and differences between day and night. As with other
components of the hydrological cycle, interannual to decadalscale
variations are substantial, but a significant upward trend
has been observed over the global oceans and over some land
areas in the Northern Hemisphere. Since observed warming
19
Section 2 Observed and projected changes in climate as they relate to water
of SST is likely to be largely anthropogenic, this suggests that
anthropogenic influence has contributed to the observed increase
in atmospheric water vapour over the oceans. However, at the
time of writing of the AR4, no formal attribution study was
available. [WGI 3.4.2, 9.5.4]
2.1.2 Snow and land ice
The cryosphere (consisting of snow, ice and frozen ground) on
land stores about 75% of the world’s freshwater. In the climate
system, the cryosphere and its changes are intricately linked to
the surface energy budget, the water cycle and sea-level change.
More than one-sixth of the world’s population lives in glacieror
snowmelt-fed river basins (Stern, 2007). [WGII 3.4.1] Figure
2.5 shows cryosphere trends, indicating significant decreases in
ice storage in many components. [WGI Chapter 4]
2.1.2.1 Snow cover, frozen ground, lake and river ice
Snow cover has decreased in most regions, especially in spring
and summer. Northern Hemisphere snow cover observed by
satellites over the 1966–2005 period decreased in every month
except November and December, with a stepwise drop of 5% in
the annual mean in the late 1980s. Declines in the mountains of
western North America and in the Swiss Alps have been largest
at lower elevations. In the Southern Hemisphere, the few long
records or proxies available mostly show either decreases or no
change in the past 40 years or more. [WGI 4.2.2]
Degradation of permafrost and seasonally frozen ground is
leading to changes in land surface characteristics and drainage
systems. Seasonally frozen ground includes both seasonal soil
freeze–thaw in non-permafrost regions and the active layer
over permafrost that thaws in summer and freezes in winter.
The estimated maximum extent of seasonally frozen ground
in non-permafrost areas has decreased by about 7% in the
Northern Hemisphere from 1901 to 2002, with a decrease of up
to 15% in spring. Its maximum depth has decreased by about
0.3 m in Eurasia since the mid-20th century in response to
winter warming and increases in snow depth. Over the period
1956 to 1990, the active layer measured at 31 stations in Russia
exhibited a statistically significant deepening of about 21 cm.
Records from other regions are too short for trend analyses.
Temperature at the top of the permafrost layer has increased
by up to 3°C since the 1980s in the Arctic. Permafrost warming
and degradation of frozen ground appear to be the result of
increased summer air temperatures and changes in the depth
and duration of snow cover. [WGI 4.7, Chapter 9]
Freeze-up and break-up dates for river and lake ice exhibit
considerable spatial variability. Averaged over available data
for the Northern Hemisphere spanning the past 150 years,
freeze-up has been delayed at a rate of 5.8 ± 1.6 days per
century, while the break-up date has occurred earlier at a rate of
6.5 ± 1.2 days per century. There are insufficient published data
on river and lake ice thickness to allow the assessment of trends.
Modelling studies (e.g., Duguay et al., 2003) indicate that much
of the variability in maximum ice thickness and break-up date
is driven by variations in snowfall. [WGI 4.3]

the smoothed time-series. [Adapted from WGI FAQ 4.1]
2.1.2.2 Glaciers and ice caps
On average, glaciers and ice caps in the Northern Hemisphere
and Patagonia show a moderate but rather consistent
increase in mass turnover over the last half-century, and
substantially increased melting. [WGI 4.5.2, 4.6.2.2.1] As
a result, considerable mass loss occurred on the majority of
glaciers and ice caps worldwide (Figure 2.6) with increasing
rates: from 1960/61 to 1989/90 the loss was 136 ± 57 Gt/yr
(0.37 ± 0.16 mm/yr sea-level equivalent, SLE), and between
1990/91 and 2003/04 it was 280 ± 79 Gt/yr (0.77 ± 0.22 mm/yr
SLE). The widespread 20th-century shrinkage appears to imply
widespread warming as the primary cause although, in the
tropics, changes in atmospheric moisture might be contributing.
There is evidence that this melting has very likely contributed to
observed sea-level rise. [WGI 4.5 Table 4.4, 9.5]

Observed and projected changes in climate as they relate to water Section 2
Formation of lakes is occurring as glacier tongues retreat from
prominent Little Ice Age (LIA) moraines in several steep
mountain ranges, including the Himalayas, the Andes, and the
Alps. These lakes have a high potential for glacial lake outburst
floods. [WGII 1.3.1.1, Table 1.2]
2.1.3 Sea level
Global mean sea level has been rising and there is high confidence
that the rate of rise has increased between the mid-19th and
the mid-20th centuries. The average rate was 1.7 ± 0.5 mm/
yr for the 20th century, 1.8 ± 0.5 mm/yr for 1961–2003, and
3.1 ± 0.7 mm/yr for 1993–2003. It is not known whether the
higher rate in 1993–2003 is due to decadal variability or to an
increase in the longer-term trend. Spatially, the change is highly
non-uniform; e.g., over the period 1993 to 2003, rates in some
regions were up to several times the global mean rise while, in
other regions, sea levels fell. [WGI 5.ES]
There are uncertainties in the estimates of the contributions to
the long-term sea-level change. For the period 1993–2003, the
contributions from thermal expansion (1.6 ± 0.5 mm/yr), mass
loss from glaciers and ice caps (0.77 ± 0.22 mm/yr) and mass
loss from the Greenland (0.21 ± 0.07 mm/yr) and Antarctic
(0.21 ± 0.35 mm/yr) ice sheets totalled 2.8 ± 0.7 mm/yr. For
this period, the sum of these climate contributions is consistent
with the directly observed sea-level rise given above, within
the observational uncertainties. For the longer period 1961–
2003, the sum of the climate contributions is estimated to be
smaller than the observed total sea-level rise; however, the
observing system was less reliable prior to 1993. For both
periods, the estimated contributions from thermal expansion
and from glaciers/ice caps are larger than the contributions
from the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets. The large error
bars for Antarctica mean that it is uncertain whether Antarctica
has contributed positively or negatively to sea level. Increases
in sea level are consistent with warming, and modelling
studies suggest that overall it is very likely that the response
to anthropogenic forcing contributed to sea-level rise during
the latter half of the 20th century; however, the observational
uncertainties, combined with a lack of suitable studies, mean
that it is difficult to quantify the anthropogenic contribution.
[WGI SPM, 5.5, 9.5.2]
Rising sea level potentially affects coastal regions, but
attribution is not always clear. Global increases in extreme high
water levels since 1975 are related to both mean sea-level rise
and large-scale inter-decadal climate variability (Woodworth
and Blackman, 2004). [WGII 1.3.3]
2.1.4 Evapotranspiration
There are very limited direct measurements of actual
evapotranspiration over global land areas, while global
Figure 2.6: Cumulative mean specific mass balances (a) and cumulative total mass balances (b) of glaciers and ice caps,
calculated for large regions (Dyurgerov and Meier, 2005). The mass balance of a glacier is the sum of all mass gains and
losses during a hydrological year. Mean specific mass balance is the total mass balance divided by the total surface area of all
glaciers and ice caps of a region, and it shows the strength of change in the respective region. Total mass balance is presented
as the contribution from each region to sea-level rise. [WGI 4.5.2, Figure 4.15]

Section 2 Observed and projected changes in climate as they relate to water
10 ‘Analysis products’ refers to estimates of past climate variations produced by assimilating a range of observations into a weather forecasting or
climate model, in the way that is done routinely to initialise daily weather forecasts. Because operational weather analysis/forecasting systems
are developed over time, a number of ‘reanalysis’ exercises have been carried out in which the available observations are assimilated into a single
system, eliminating any spurious jumps or trends due to changes in the underlying system. An advantage of analysis systems is that they produce
global fields that include many quantities that are not directly observed. A potential disadvantage is that all fields are a mixture of observations
and models, and for regions/variables for which there are few observations, may represent largely the climatology of the underlying model.
analysis products10 are sensitive to the type of analysis and
can contain large errors, and thus are not suitable for trend
analysis. Therefore, there is little literature on observed trends
in evapotranspiration, whether actual or potential. [WGI 3.3.3]
2.1.4.1 Pan evaporation
Decreasing trends during recent decades are found in sparse
records of pan evaporation (measured evaporation from an open
water surface in a pan, a proxy for potential evapotranspiration)
over the USA (Peterson et al., 1995; Golubev et al., 2001; Hobbins
et al., 2004), India (Chattopadhyay and Hulme, 1997), Australia
(Roderick and Farquhar, 2004), New Zealand (Roderick and
Farquhar, 2005), China (Liu et al., 2004; Qian et al., 2006b)
and Thailand (Tebakari et al., 2005). Pan measurements do not
represent actual evaporation (Brutsaert and Parlange, 1998),
and trends may be caused by decreasing surface solar radiation
(over the USA and parts of Europe and Russia) and decreased
sunshine duration over China that may be related to increases
in air pollution and atmospheric aerosols and increases in cloud
cover. [WGI 3.3.3, Box 3.2]
2.1.4.2 Actual evapotranspiration
The TAR reported that actual evapotranspiration increased
during the second half of the 20th century over most dry
regions of the USA and Russia (Golubev et al., 2001), resulting
from greater availability of surface moisture due to increased
precipitation and larger atmospheric moisture demand due
to higher temperature. Using observations of precipitation,
temperature, cloudiness-based surface solar radiation and a
comprehensive land surface model, Qian et al. (2006a) found
that global land evapotranspiration closely follows variations
in land precipitation. Global precipitation values peaked in the
early 1970s and then decreased somewhat, but reflect mainly
tropical values, and precipitation has increased more generally
over land at higher latitudes. Changes in evapotranspiration
depend not only on moisture supply but also on energy
availability and surface wind. [WGI 3.3.3]
Other factors affecting actual evapotranspiration include
the direct effects of atmospheric CO2 enrichment on plant
physiology. The literature on these direct effects, with respect
to observed evapotranspiration trends, is non-existent, although
effects on runoff have been seen. [WGI 9.5.4]
Annual amounts of evapotranspiration depend, in part, on the
length of the growing season. The AR4 presents evidence for
observed increases in growing season length. These increases,
associated with earlier last spring frost and delayed autumn
frost dates, are clearly apparent in temperate regions of Eurasia
(Moonen et al., 2002; Menzel et al., 2003; Genovese et al.,
2005; Semenov et al., 2006) and a major part of North America
(Robeson, 2002; Feng and Hu, 2004). [WGII 1.3.6.1]
2.1.5 Soil moisture
Historical records of soil moisture content measured in situ
are available for only a few regions and are often very short
in duration. [WGI 3.3.4] Among more than 600 stations from
a large variety of climates, Robock et al. (2000) identified an
increasing long-term trend in surface (top 1 m) soil moisture
content during summer for the stations with the longest records,
mostly located in the former Soviet Union, China, and central
USA. The longest records available, from the Ukraine, show
overall increases in surface soil moisture, although increases
are less marked in recent decades (Robock et al., 2005). The
initial approach to estimating soil moisture has been to calculate
Palmer Drought Severity Index (PDSI) values from observed
precipitation and temperature. PDSI changes are discussed in
Section 3.1.2.4. [WGI Box 3.1, 3.3.4]
2.1.6 Runoff and river discharge
A large number of studies have examined potential trends
in measures of river discharge during the 20th century, at
scales ranging from catchment to global. Some have detected
significant trends in some indicators of flow, and some have
demonstrated statistically significant links with trends in
temperature or precipitation. Many studies, however, have
found no trends or have been unable to separate out the effects
of variations in temperature and precipitation from the effects
of human interventions in the catchment. The methodology
used to search for trends can also influence results. For
example, different statistical tests can give different indications
of significance; different periods of record (particularly start
and end dates) can suggest different rates of change; failing
to allow for cross-correlation between catchments can lead
to an overestimation of the numbers of catchments showing
significant change. Another limitation of trend analysis is the
availability of consistent, quality-controlled data. Available
streamflow gauge records cover only about two-thirds of the
global actively drained land area and often contain gaps and
vary in record length (Dai and Trenberth, 2002). Finally, human
interventions have affected flow regimes in many catchments.
[WGI 3.3.4, 9.1, 9.5.1; WGII 1.3.2]
At the global scale, there is evidence of a broadly coherent pattern
of change in annual runoff, with some regions experiencing an
increase in runoff (e.g., high latitudes and large parts of the
USA) and others (such as parts of West Africa, southern Europe
and southernmost South America) experiencing a decrease in
22
Observed and projected changes in climate as they relate to water Section 2
runoff (Milly et al., 2005, and many catchment-scale studies).
Variations in flow from year to year are also influenced in many
parts of the world by large-scale climatic patterns associated,
for example, with ENSO, the NAO and the PNA pattern.11 One
study (Labat et al., 2004) claimed a 4% increase in global total
runoff per 1°C rise in temperature during the 20th century, with
regional variations around this trend, but debate around this
conclusion (Labat et al., 2004; Legates et al., 2005) has focused
on the effects of non-climatic drivers on runoff and the influence
of a small number of data points on the results. Gedney et al.
(2006) attributed widespread increases in runoff during the
20th century largely to the suppression of evapotranspiration
by increasing CO2 concentrations (which affect stomatal
conductance), although other evidence for such a relationship
is difficult to find and Section 2.1.4 presents evidence for an
increase in evapotranspiration. [WGII 1.3.2]
Trends in runoff are not always consistent with changes in
precipitation. This may be due to data limitations (in particular
the coverage of precipitation data), the effect of human
interventions such as reservoir impoundment (as is the case with
the major Eurasian rivers), or the competing effects of changes
in precipitation and temperature (as in Sweden: see Lindstrom
and Bergstrom, 2004).
There is, however, far more robust and widespread evidence
that the timing of river flows in many regions where winter
precipitation falls as snow has been significantly altered. Higher
temperatures mean that a greater proportion of the winter
precipitation falls as rain rather than snow, and the snowmelt
season begins earlier. Snowmelt in parts of New England shifted
forward by 1 to 2 weeks between 1936 and 2000 (Hodgkins
et al., 2003), although this has had little discernible effect on
summer flows (Hodgkins et al., 2005). [WGII 1.3.2]
2.1.7 Patterns of large-scale variability
The climate system has a number of preferred patterns of
variability having a direct influence on elements of the
hydrological cycle. Regional climates may vary out of phase,
owing to the action of such ‘teleconnections’. Teleconnections
are often associated with droughts and floods, and with other
changes which have significant impacts on humans. A brief
overview is given below of the key teleconnection patterns. A more
complete discussion is given in Section 3.6 of the WGI AR4.
A teleconnection is defined by a spatial pattern and a timeseries
describing variations in its magnitude and phase. Spatial
patterns may be defined over a grid or by indices based on
station observations. For example, the Southern Oscillation
Index (SOI) is based solely on differences in mean sea-level
pressure anomalies between Tahiti (eastern Pacific) and Darwin
(western Pacific), yet it captures much of the variability of
large-scale atmospheric circulation throughout the tropical
Pacific. Teleconnection patterns tend to be most prominent in
winter (especially in the Northern Hemisphere), when the mean
circulation is strongest. The strength of teleconnections, and the
way in which they influence surface climate, also varies over
long time-scales. [WGI 3.6.1]
The SOI describes the atmospheric component of the El
Niño–Southern Oscillation (ENSO), the most significant mode
of interannual variability of the global climate. ENSO has
global impacts on atmospheric circulation, precipitation and
temperature (Trenberth and Caron, 2000). ENSO is associated
with an east–west shift in tropical Pacific precipitation, and with
modulation of the main tropical convergence zones. ENSO is
also associated with wave-like disturbances to the atmospheric
circulation outside the tropics, such as the Pacific–North
American (PNA) and Pacific–South American (PSA) patterns,
which have major regional climate effects. The strength
and frequency of ENSO events vary on the decadal scale, in
association with the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO, also
known as the Inter-decadal Pacific Oscillation or IPO), which
modulates the mean state of ocean surface temperatures and
the tropical atmospheric circulation on time-scales of 20 years
and longer. The climate shift in 1976/77 (Trenberth, 1990) was
associated with changes in El Niño evolution (Trenberth and
Stepaniak, 2001) and a tendency towards more prolonged and
stronger El Niños. As yet there is no formally detectable change
in ENSO variability in observations. [WGI 3.6.2, 3.6.3]
Outside the tropics, variability of the atmospheric circulation
on time-scales of a month or longer is dominated by variations
in the strength and locations of the jet streams and associated
storm tracks, characterised by the Northern and Southern
‘Annular Modes’ (NAM and SAM, respectively: Quadrelli and
Wallace, 2004; Trenberth et al., 2005). The NAM is closely
related to the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO), although
the latter is most strongly associated with the Atlantic storm
track and with climate variations over Europe. The NAO is
characterised by out-of-phase pressure anomalies between
temperate and high latitudes over the Atlantic sector. The
NAO has its strongest signature in winter, when its positive
(negative) phase exhibits an enhanced (diminished) Iceland
Low and Azores High (Hurrell et al., 2003). The closely related
NAM has a similar structure over the Atlantic, but is more
longitudinally symmetrical. The NAO has a strong influence on
wintertime surface temperatures across much of the Northern
Hemisphere, and on storminess and precipitation over Europe
and North Africa, with a poleward shift in precipitation in the
positive phase and an Equatorward shift in the negative phase.
There is evidence of prolonged positive and negative NAO
periods during the last few centuries (Cook et al., 2002; Jones
et al., 2003a). In winter, a reversal occurred from the minimum
index values in the late 1960s to strongly positive NAO index
values in the mid-1990s. Since then, NAO values have declined
to near their long-term mean. Attribution studies suggest that
the trend over recent decades in the NAM is likely to be related
in part to human activity. However, the response to natural and
anthropogenic forcings that is simulated by climate models is
smaller than the observed trend. [WGI 3.6.4, 9.ES]
11 Respectively, ENSO = El Niño–Southern Oscillation, NAO = North Atlantic Oscillation, PNA = Pacific–North American; see Section 2.1.7 and
Glossary for further explanation.
23
Section 2 Observed and projected changes in climate as they relate to water
The Southern Annular Mode (SAM) is associated with
synchronous pressure variations of opposite sign in mid- and
high latitudes, reflecting changes in the main belt of sub-polar
westerly winds. Enhanced Southern Ocean westerlies occur in
the positive phase of the SAM, which has become more common
in recent decades, leading to more cyclones in the circumpolar
trough (Sinclair et al., 1997), a poleward shift in precipitation,
and a greater contribution to Antarctic precipitation (Noone
and Simmonds, 2002). The SAM also affects spatial patterns
of precipitation variability in Antarctica (Genthon et al., 2003)
and southern South America (Silvestri and Vera, 2003). Model
simulations suggest that the recent trend in the SAM has been
affected by increased greenhouse gas concentration and, in
particular, by stratospheric ozone depletion. [WGI 3.6.5,
9.5.3.3]
North Atlantic SSTs show about a 70-year variation during the
instrumental period (and in proxy reconstructions), termed the
Atlantic Multi-decadal Oscillation (AMO: Kerr, 2000). A warm
phase occurred during 1930–1960 and cool phases during 1905–
1925 and 1970–1990 (Schlesinger and Ramankutty, 1994). The
AMO appears to have returned to a warm phase beginning in the
mid-1990s. The AMO may be related to changes in the strength
of the thermohaline circulation (Delworth and Mann, 2000; Latif,
2001; Sutton and Hodson, 2003; Knight et al., 2005). The AMO
has been linked to multi-year precipitation anomalies over North
America, appears to modulate ENSO teleconnections (Enfield et
al., 2001; McCabe et al., 2004; Shabbar and Skinner, 2004) and
also plays a role in Atlantic hurricane formation (Goldenberg et
al., 2001). The AMO is believed to be a driver of multi-decadal
variations in Sahel drought, precipitation in the Caribbean,
summertime climate of both North America and Europe, sea-ice
concentration in the Greenland Sea, and sea-level pressure over
the southern USA, the North Atlantic and southern Europe (e.g.,
Venegas and Mysak, 2000; Goldenberg et al., 2001; Sutton and
Hodson, 2005; Trenberth and Shea, 2006). [WGI 3.6.6]
2.2.1 Land surface effects
Surface water balances reflect the availability of both water
and energy. In regions where water availability is high,
evapotranspiration is controlled by the properties of both
the atmospheric boundary layer and surface vegetation cover.
Changes in the surface water balance can feed back on the
climate system by recycling water into the boundary layer
(instead of allowing it to run off or penetrate to deep soil levels).
The sign and magnitude of such effects are often highly variable,
depending on the details of the local environment. Hence, while
in some cases these feedbacks may be relatively small on a global
scale, they may become extremely important at smaller spaceor
time-scales, leading to regional/local changes in variability or
extremes. [WGI 7.2]
The impacts of deforestation on climate illustrate this complexity.
Some studies indicate that deforestation could lead to reduced
daytime temperatures and increases in boundary layer cloud as a
consequence of rising albedo, transpiration and latent heat loss.
However, these effects are dependent on the properties of both
the replacement vegetation and the underlying soil/snow surface
– and in some cases the opposite effects have been suggested. The
effects of deforestation on precipitation are likewise complex,
with both negative and positive impacts being found, dependent
on land surface and vegetation characteristics. [WGI 7.2, 7.5]
A number of studies have suggested that, in semi-arid regions such
as the Sahel, the presence of vegetation can enhance conditions
for its own growth by recycling soil water into the atmosphere,
from where it can be precipitated again. This can result in the
possibility of multiple equilibria for such regions, either with
or without precipitation and vegetation, and also suggests the
possibility of abrupt regime transitions, as may have happened
in the change from mid-Holocene to modern conditions. [WGI
Chapter 6, 7.2]
Soil moisture is a source of thermal inertia due to its heat capacity
and the latent heat required for evaporation. For this reason,
soil moisture has been proposed as an important control on,
for example, summer temperature and precipitation. Feedbacks
between soil moisture, precipitation and temperature are
particularly important in transition regions between dry and humid
areas, but the strength of the coupling between soil moisture and
precipitation varies by an order of magnitude between different
climate models, and observational constraints are not currently
available to narrow this uncertainty. [WGI 7.2, 8.2]
A further control on precipitation arises through stomatal closure
in response to increasing atmospheric CO2 concentrations. In
addition to its tendency to increase runoff through large-scale
decreases in total evapotranspiration (Section 2.3.4), this effect
may result in substantial reductions in precipitation in some
regions. [WGI 7.2]
Changes in snow cover as a result of regional warming feed back
on temperature through albedo changes. While the magnitude
2.2 Influences and feedbacks of
iiiiiiihydrological changes on climate
Some robust correlations have been observed between
temperature and precipitation in many regions. This provides
evidence that processes controlling the hydrological cycle and
temperature are closely coupled. At a global scale, changes in
water vapour, clouds and ice change the radiation balance of the
Earth and hence play a major role in determining the climate
response to increasing greenhouse gases. The global impact of
these processes on temperature response is discussed in WGI
AR4 Section 8.6. In this section, we discuss some processes
through which changes in hydrological variables can produce
feedback effects on regional climate, or on the atmospheric
budget of major greenhouse gases. The purpose of this section
is not to provide a comprehensive discussion of such processes,
but to illustrate the tight coupling of hydrological processes to
the rest of the climate system. [WGI 3.3.5, Chapter 7, 8.6]
24
Observed and projected changes in climate as they relate to water Section 2
of this feedback varies substantially between models, recent
studies suggest that the rate of spring snowmelt may provide
a good, observable estimate of this feedback strength, offering
the prospect of reduced uncertainty in future predictions of
temperature change in snow-covered regions. [WGI 8.6]
2.2.2 Feedbacks through changes in ocean
iiiiiiiiiiiiiiiicirculation
Freshwater input to the ocean changes the salinity, and hence
the density, of sea water. Thus, changes in the hydrological
cycle can change the density-driven (‘thermohaline’) ocean
circulation, and thence feed back on climate. A particular
example is the meridional overturning circulation (MOC) in the
North Atlantic Ocean. This circulation has a substantial impact
on surface temperature, precipitation and sea level in regions
around the North Atlantic and beyond. The Atlantic MOC is
projected to weaken during the 21st century, and this weakening
is important in modulating the overall climate change response.
In general, a weakening MOC is expected to moderate the
rate of warming at northern mid-latitudes, but some studies
suggest that it would also result in an increased rate of warming
in the Arctic. These responses also feed back on large-scale
precipitation through changes in evaporation from the low- and
mid-latitude Atlantic. While in many models the largest driver
of MOC weakening is surface warming (rather than freshening),
in the deep water source regions, hydrological changes do play
an important role, and uncertainty in the freshwater input is a
major contribution to the large inter-model spread in projections
of MOC response. Observed changes in ocean salinity over
recent decades are suggestive of changes in freshwater input.
While nearly all atmosphere–ocean general circulation model
(AOGCM) integrations show a weakening MOC in the 21st
century, none shows an abrupt transition to a different state.
Such an event is considered very unlikely in the 21st century,
but it is not possible to assess the likelihood of such events in
the longer term. [WGI 10.3.4]
Changes in precipitation, evaporation and runoff, and their
impact on the MOC, are explicitly modelled in current climate
projections. However, few climate models include a detailed
representation of changes in the mass balance of the Greenland
and Antarctic ice sheets, which represent a possible additional
source of freshwater to the ocean. The few studies available to
date that include detailed modelling of freshwater input from
Greenland do not suggest that this extra source will change the
broad conclusions presented above. [WGI 5.2, 8.7, 10.3, Box 10.1]
2.2.3 Emissions and sinks affected by
hydrological processes or biogeochemical
feedbacks
Changes in the hydrological cycle can feed back on climate
through changes in the atmospheric budgets of carbon dioxide,
methane and other radiatively-active chemical species, often
regulated by the biosphere. The processes involved are complex;
for example the response of heterotrophic soil respiration,
a source of CO2, to increasing temperature depends strongly
on the amount of soil moisture. A new generation of climate
models, in which vegetation and the carbon cycle respond to
the changing climate, has allowed some of these processes to
be explored for the first time. All models suggest that there is a
positive feedback of climate change on the global carbon cycle,
resulting in a larger proportion of anthropogenic CO2 emissions
remaining in the atmosphere in a warmer climate. However,
the magnitude of the overall feedback varies substantially
between models; changes in net terrestrial primary productivity
are particularly uncertain, reflecting the underlying spread in
projections of regional precipitation change. [WGI 7.3]
A number of sources and sinks of methane are sensitive to
hydrological change, for example wetlands, permafrost,
rice agriculture (sources) and soil oxidation (sink). Other
active chemical species such as ozone have also been shown
to be sensitive to climate, again typically through complex
biogeochemical mechanisms. Atmospheric aerosol budgets
are directly sensitive to precipitation (e.g., through damping of
terrestrial dust sources and the importance of wet deposition
as a sink), and aerosols feed back onto precipitation by acting
as condensation nuclei and so influencing the precipitation
efficiency of clouds. The magnitude of these feedbacks remains
uncertain, and they are generally included only in simple ways,
if at all, in the current generation of climate models. [WGI 7.4]
2.3 Projected changes in climate as they
iiiiiiirelate to water
A major advance in climate change projections, compared
with those considered under the TAR, is the large number of
simulations available from a broader range of climate models,
run for various emissions scenarios. Best-estimate projections
from models indicate that decadal average warming over each
inhabited continent by 2030 is insensitive to the choice of SRES
scenario and is very likely to be at least twice as large (around
0.2°C per decade) as the corresponding model-estimated natural
variability during the 20th century. Continued greenhouse gas
emissions at or above current rates under SRES non-mitigation
scenarios would cause further warming and induce many
changes in the global climate system during the 21st century,
with these changes very likely to be larger than those observed
during the 20th century. Projected global average temperature
change for 2090–2099 (relative to 1980–1999), under the
SRES illustrative marker scenarios, ranges from 1.8°C (best
estimate, likely range 1.1°C to 2.9°C) for scenario B1, to 4.0°C
(best estimate, likely range 2.4°C to 6.4°C) for scenario A1FI.
Warming is projected to be greatest over land and at most high
northern latitudes, and least over the Southern Ocean and parts
of the North Atlantic Ocean. It is very likely that hot extremes
and heatwaves will continue to become more frequent.
[WGI SPM, Chapter 10]
Uncertainty in hydrological projections
Uncertainties in projected changes in the hydrological system
arise from internal variability of the climate system, uncertainty
25
Section 2 Observed and projected changes in climate as they relate to water
in future greenhouse gas and aerosol emissions, the translation
of these emissions into climate change by global climate models,
and hydrological model uncertainty. By the late 21st century,
under the A1B scenario, differences between climate model
precipitation projections are a larger source of uncertainty than
internal variability. This also implies that, in many cases, the
modelled changes in annual mean precipitation exceed the
(modelled) internal variability by this time. Projections become
less consistent between models as the spatial scale decreases.
[WGI 10.5.4.3] At high latitudes and in parts of the tropics, all
or nearly all models project an increase in precipitation, while in
some sub-tropical and lower mid-latitude regions precipitation
decreases in all or nearly all models. Between these areas of
robust increase and decrease, even the sign of precipitation
change is inconsistent across the current generation of models.
[WGI 10.3.2.3, 10.5.4.3] For other aspects of the hydrological
cycle, such as changes in evaporation, soil moisture and runoff,
the relative spread in projections is similar to, or larger than, the
changes in precipitation. [WGI 10.3.2.3]
Further sources of uncertainty in hydrological projections
arise from the structure of current climate models. Some
examples of processes that are, at best, only simply represented
in climate models are given in Section 2.2. Current models
generally exclude some feedbacks from vegetation change to
climate change. Most, although not all, of the simulations used
for deriving climate projections also exclude anthropogenic
changes in land cover. The treatment of anthropogenic aerosol
forcing is relatively simple in most climate models. While some
models include a wide range of anthropogenic aerosol species,
potentially important species, such as black carbon, are lacking
from most of the simulations used for the AR4 (see discussion
of the attribution of observed changes, in Section 2.1). More
than half of the AR4 models also exclude the indirect effects
of aerosols on clouds. The resolution of current climate models
also limits the proper representation of tropical cyclones and
heavy rainfall. [WGI 8.2.1, 8.2.2, 8.5.2, 8.5.3, 10.2.1]
Uncertainties arise from the incorporation of climate model
results into freshwater studies for two reasons: the different
spatial scales of global climate models and hydrological
models, and biases in the long-term mean precipitation as
computed by global climate models for the current climate.
A number of methods have been used to address the scale
differences, ranging from the simple interpolation of climate
model results to dynamic or statistical downscaling methods,
but all such methods introduce uncertainties into the projection.
Biases in simulated mean precipitation are often addressed by
adding modelled anomalies to the observed precipitation in
order to obtain the driving dataset for hydrological models.
Therefore, changes in interannual or day-to-day variability
of climate parameters are not taken into account in most
hydrological impact studies. This leads to an underestimation
of future floods, droughts and irrigation water requirements.
[WGII 3.3.1]
The uncertainties in climate change impacts on water resources,
droughts and floods arise for various reasons, such as different
scenarios of economic development, greenhouse gas emissions,
climate modelling and hydrological modelling. However, there
has not yet been a study that assesses how different hydrological
models react to the same climate change signal. [WGII 3.3.1]
Since the TAR, the uncertainty of climate model projections
for freshwater assessments is often taken into account by using
multi-model ensembles. Formal probabilistic assessments are
still rare. [WGII 3.3.1, 3.4]
Despite these uncertainties, some robust results are available. In
the sections that follow, uncertainties in projected changes are
discussed, based on the assessments in AR4.
2.3.1 Precipitation (including extremes) and
water vapour
2.3.1.1 Mean precipitation
Climate projections using multi-model ensembles show
increases in globally averaged mean water vapour, evaporation
and precipitation over the 21st century. The models suggest
that precipitation generally increases in the areas of regional
tropical precipitation maxima (such as the monsoon regimes,
and the tropical Pacific in particular) and at high latitudes, with
general decreases in the sub-tropics. [WGI SPM, 10.ES, 10.3.1,
10.3.2]
Increases in precipitation at high latitudes in both the winter
and summer seasons are highly consistent across models (see
Figure 2.7). Precipitation increases over the tropical oceans and
in some of the monsoon regimes, e.g., the south Asian monsoon
in summer (June to August) and the Australian monsoon in
summer (December to February), are notable and, while not
as consistent locally, considerable agreement is found at the
broader scale in the tropics. There are widespread decreases
in mid-latitude summer precipitation, except for increases in
eastern Asia. Decreases in precipitation over many sub-tropical
areas are evident in the multi-model ensemble mean, and
consistency in the sign of change among the models is often
high – particularly in some regions such as the tropical Central
American—Caribbean and the Mediterranean. [WGI 10.3.2]
Further discussion of regional changes is presented in Section 5.
The global distribution of the 2080–2099 change in annual mean
precipitation for the SRES A1B scenario is shown in Figure 2.8,
along with some other hydrological quantities from a 15-model
ensemble. Increases in annual precipitation exceeding 20%
occur in most high latitudes, as well as in eastern Africa, the
northern part of central Asia and the equatorial Pacific Ocean.
Substantial decreases of up to 20% occur in the Mediterranean
and Caribbean regions and on the sub-tropical western coasts of
each continent. Overall, precipitation over land increases some
5%, while precipitation over oceans increases 4%. The net
change over land accounts for 24% of the global mean increase
in precipitation. [WGI 10.3.2]
In climate model projections for the 21st century, global mean
evaporation changes closely balance global precipitation
change, but this relationship is not evident at the local scale
26
Observed and projected changes in climate as they relate to water Section 2
because of changes in the atmospheric transport of water vapour.
Annual average evaporation increases over much of the ocean,
with spatial variations tending to relate to variations in surface
warming. Atmospheric moisture convergence increases over
the equatorial oceans and over high latitudes. Over land, rainfall
changes tend to be balanced by both evaporation and runoff.
On global scales, the water vapour content of the atmosphere
is projected to increase in response to warmer temperatures,
with relative humidity remaining roughly constant. These
water vapour increases provide a positive feedback on climate
warming, since water vapour is a greenhouse gas. Associated
with this is a change in the vertical profile of atmospheric
temperature (‘lapse rate’), which partly offsets the positive
feedback. Recent evidence from models and observations
strongly supports a combined water vapour/lapse rate feedback
on climate of a strength comparable with that found in climate
general circulation models. [WGI 8.6, 10.ES, 10.3.2]
2.3.1.2 Precipitation extremes
It is very likely that heavy precipitation events will become
more frequent. Intensity of precipitation events is projected to
increase, particularly in tropical and high-latitude areas that
experience increases in mean precipitation. There is a tendency
for drying in mid-continental areas during summer, indicating
a greater risk of droughts in these regions. In most tropical and
mid- and high-latitude areas, extreme precipitation increases
more than mean precipitation. [WGI 10.3.5, 10.3.6]
A long-standing result from global coupled models noted in the
TAR was a projected increased likelihood of summer drying in
the mid-latitudes, with an associated increased risk of drought
(Figure 2.8). Fifteen recent AOGCM runs for a future warmer climate
indicate summer dryness in most parts of the northern sub-tropics and
mid-latitudes, but there is a large range in the amplitude of summer
dryness across models. Droughts associated with this summer
drying could result in regional vegetation die-off and contribute to
an increase in the percentage of land area experiencing drought
at any one time; for example, extreme drought increasing from
1% of present-day land area (by definition) to 30% by 2100
in the A2 scenario. Drier soil conditions can also contribute to
more severe heatwaves. [WGI 10.3.6]
Also associated with the risk of drying is a projected increase
in the risk of intense precipitation and flooding. Though
somewhat counter-intuitive, this is because precipitation is
projected to be concentrated in more intense events, with longer
periods of lower precipitation in between (see Section 2.1.1 for
further explanation). Therefore, intense and heavy episodic
rainfall events with high runoff amounts are interspersed with
longer relatively dry periods with increased evapotranspiration,
particularly in the sub-tropics. However, depending on the
threshold used to define such events, an increase in the
frequency of dry days does not necessarily mean a decrease in
the frequency of extreme high-rainfall events. Another aspect of
these changes has been related to changes in mean precipitation,
with wet extremes becoming more severe in many areas where
mean precipitation increases, and dry extremes becoming more
severe where mean precipitation decreases. [WGI 10.3.6]
Multi-model climate projections for the 21st century show
increases in both precipitation intensity and number of
consecutive dry days in many regions (Figure 2.9). Precipitation
intensity increases almost everywhere, but particularly at midand
high latitudes where mean precipitation also increases.
However, in Figure 2.9 (lower part), there are regions of
increased runs of dry days between precipitation events in the
sub-tropics and lower mid-latitudes, but decreased runs of dry
days at higher mid-latitudes and high latitudes where mean
precipitation increases. [WGI 10.3.6.1]
Since there are areas of both increases and decreases in
consecutive dry days between precipitation events in the
Figure 2.7: Fifteen-model mean changes in precipitation (unit: mm/day) for DJF (left) and JJA (right). Changes are given
for the SRES A1B scenario, for the period 2080–2099 relative to 1980–1999. Stippling denotes areas where the magnitude of
the multi-model ensemble mean exceeds the inter-model standard deviation. [WGI Figure 10.9]
27
Section 2 Observed and projected changes in climate as they relate to water
multi-model average (Figure 2.9), the global mean trends
are smaller and less consistent across models. A perturbed
physics ensemble with one model shows only limited areas of
consistently increased frequency of wet days in July. In this
ensemble there is a larger range of changes in precipitation
extremes relative to the control ensemble mean (comparedwith
the more consistent response of temperature extremes). This
indicates a less consistent response for precipitation extremes
in general, compared with temperature extremes. [WGI 10.3.6,
FAQ10.1]
Based on a range of models, it is likely that future tropical
cyclones will become more intense, with larger peak wind
speeds and more heavy precipitation associated with ongoing
increases in tropical sea surface temperatures. There is less
confidence in projections of a global decrease in numbers of
tropical cyclones. [WGI SPM]
2.3.2 Snow and land ice
As the climate warms, snow cover is projected to contract
and decrease, and glaciers and ice caps to lose mass, as a
consequence of the increase in summer melting being greater
than the increase in winter snowfall. Widespread increases in
thaw depth over much of the permafrost regions are projected
to occur in response to warming. [WGI SPM, 10.3.3]
2.3.2.1 Changes in snow cover, frozen ground, lake and
iiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiriver ice
Snow cover is an integrated response to both temperature and
precipitation, and it exhibits a strong negative correlation with
air temperature in most areas with seasonal snow cover. Because
of this temperature association, simulations project widespread
reductions in snow cover throughout the 21st century, despite
some projected increases at higher altitudes. For example,
Figure 2.8: Fifteen-model mean changes in (a) precipitation (%), (b) soil moisture content (%), (c) runoff (%), and (d)
evaporation (%). To indicate consistency of sign of change, regions are stippled where at least 80% of models agree on
the sign of the mean change. Changes are annual means for the scenario SRES A1B for the period 2080–2099 relative to
1980–1999. Soil moisture and runoff changes are shown at land points with valid data from at least ten models. [Based on
WGI Figure 10.12]
28
Observed and projected changes in climate as they relate to water Section 2
climate models used in the Arctic Climate Impact Assessment
(ACIA) project a 9–17% reduction in the annual mean Northern
Hemisphere snow coverage under the B2 scenario by the end
of the century. In general, the snow accumulation season is
projected to begin later, the melting season to begin earlier,
and the fractional snow coverage to decrease during the snow
season. [WGI 10.3.3.2, Chapter 11]
Results from models forced with a range of IPCC climate
scenarios indicate that by the mid-21st century the permafrost
area in the Northern Hemisphere is likely to decrease by 20–
35%. Projected changes in the depth of seasonal thawing are
uniform neither in space nor in time. In the next three decades,
active layer depths are likely to be within 10–15% of their
present values over most of the permafrost area; by the middle
of the century, the depth of seasonal thawing may increase on
average by 15–25%, and by 50% or more in the northernmost
locations; by 2080, it is likely to increase by 30–50% or more
over all permafrost areas. [WGII 15.3.4]
Warming is forecast to cause reductions in river and lake ice.
This effect, however, is expected to be offset on some large
northward-flowing rivers because of reduced regional contrasts
in south-to-north temperatures and in related hydrological and
physical gradients. [WGII 15.4.1.2]
2.3.2.2 Glaciers and ice caps
As the climate warms throughout the 21st century, glaciers and
ice caps are projected to lose mass owing to a dominance of
summer melting over winter precipitation increases. Based on
simulations of 11 glaciers in various regions, a volume loss
of 60% of these glaciers is projected by 2050 (Schneeberger
et al., 2003). A comparative study including seven GCM
simulations at 2 × atmospheric CO2 conditions inferred that
many glaciers may disappear completely due to an increase
in the equilibrium-line altitude (Bradley et al., 2004). The
disappearance of these ice bodies is much faster than a potential
re-glaciation several centuries hence, and may in some areas
be irreversible. [WGI 10.7.4.2, Box 10.1] Global 21st-century
projections show glacier and ice cap shrinkage of 0.07–0.17 m
sea-level equivalent (SLE) out of today’s estimated glacier and
ice cap mass of 0.15–0.37 m SLE. [WGI Chapter 4, Table 4.1,
10, Table 10.7]
2.3.3 Sea level
Because our present understanding of some important effects
driving sea-level rise is too limited, AR4 does not assess the
likelihood, nor provide a best estimate or an upper bound for
sea-level rise. The projections do not include either uncertainties
in climate–carbon cycle feedbacks or the full effects of changes
in ice sheet flow; therefore the upper values of the ranges are
not to be considered upper bounds for sea-level rise. Modelbased
projections of global mean sea-level rise between the
late 20th century (1980–1999) and the end of this century
(2090–2099) are of the order of 0.18 to 0.59 m, based on the
spread of AOGCM results and different SRES scenarios, but
excluding the uncertainties noted above. In all the SRES marker
scenarios except B1, the average rate of sea-level rise during
the 21st century is very likely to exceed the 1961–2003 average
rate (1.8 ± 0.5 mm/yr). Thermal expansion is the largest
component, contributing 70–75% of the central estimate in
these projections for all scenarios. Glaciers, ice caps and the
Greenland ice sheet are also projected to contribute positively
to sea level. GCMs indicate that, overall, the Antarctic ice
sheet will receive increased snowfall without experiencing
substantial surface melting, thus gaining mass and contributing
negatively to sea level. Sea-level rise during the 21st century
is projected to have substantial geographical variability. [SYR
3.2.1; WGI SPM, 10.6.5, TS 5.2] Partial loss of the Greenland
and/or Antarctic ice sheets could imply several metres of sealevel
rise, major changes in coastlines and inundation of low-

simulations from nine global coupled climate models in
2080–2099 relative to 1980–1999 for the A1B scenario.
Changes in spatial patterns of precipitation intensity (defined
as the annual total precipitation divided by the number of
wet days) (top); and changes in spatial patterns of dry days

days) (bottom). Stippling denotes areas where at least five
of the nine models concur in determining that the change
is statistically significant. Extreme indices are calculated

deviations. [WGI Figure 10.18]
29
Section 2 Observed and projected changes in climate as they relate to water
lying areas, with the greatest effects in river deltas and lowlying
islands. Current modelling suggests that such changes are
possible for Greenland over millennial time-scales, but because
dynamic ice flow processes in both ice sheets are currently
poorly understood, more rapid sea-level rise on century timescales
cannot be excluded. [WGI SPM; WGII 19.3]
2.3.4 Evapotranspiration
Evaporative demand, or ‘potential evaporation’, is projected to
increase almost everywhere. This is because the water-holding
capacity of the atmosphere increases with higher temperatures,
but relative humidity is not projected to change markedly.
Water vapour deficit in the atmosphere increases as a result,
as does the evaporation rate (Trenberth et al., 2003). [WGI
Figures 10.9, 10.12; WGII 3.2, 3.3.1] Actual evaporation over
open water is projected to increase, e.g., over much of the
ocean [WGI Figure 10.12] and lakes, with the spatial variations
tending to relate to spatial variations in surface warming. [WGI
10.3.2.3, Figure 10.8] Changes in evapotranspiration over land
are controlled by changes in precipitation and radiative forcing,
and the changes would, in turn, impact on the water balance of
runoff, soil moisture, water in reservoirs, the groundwater table
and the salinisation of shallow aquifers. [WGII 3.4.2]
Carbon dioxide enrichment of the atmosphere has two potential
competing implications for evapotranspiration from vegetation.
On the one hand, higher CO2 concentrations can reduce
transpiration because the stomata of leaves, through which
transpiration from plants takes place, need to open less in order to
take up the same amount of CO2 for photosynthesis (see Gedney
et al., 2006, although other evidence for such a relationship is
difficult to find). Conversely, higher CO2 concentrations can
increase plant growth, resulting in increased leaf area, and
thus increased transpiration. The relative magnitudes of these
two effects vary between plant types and in response to other
influences, such as the availability of nutrients and the effects of
changes in temperature and water availability. Accounting for
the effects of CO2 enrichment on evapotranspiration requires the
incorporation of a dynamic vegetation model. A small number of
models now do this (Rosenberg et al., 2003; Gerten et al., 2004;
Gordon and Famiglietti, 2004; Betts et al., 2007), but usually at
the global, rather than catchment, scale. Although studies with
equilibrium vegetation models suggested that increased leaf
area may offset stomatal closure (Betts et al., 1997; Kergoat
et al., 2002), studies with dynamic global vegetation models
indicate that the effects of stomatal closure exceed those of
increasing leaf area. Taking into account CO2-induced changes
in vegetation, global mean runoff under a 2×CO2 climate has
been simulated to increase by approximately 5% as a result
of reduced evapotranspiration due to CO2 enrichment alone
(Leipprand and Gerten, 2006; Betts et al., 2007). [WGII 3.4.1]
2.3.5 Soil moisture
Changes in soil moisture depend on changes in the volume and
timing not only of precipitation, but also of evaporation (which
may be affected by changes in vegetation). The geographical
distribution of changes in soil moisture is therefore slightly
different from the distribution of changes in precipitation; higher
evaporation can more than offset increases in precipitation.
Models simulate the moisture in the upper few metres of the
land surface in varying ways, and evaluation of the soil moisture
content is still difficult. Projections of annual mean soil moisture
content (Figure 2.8b) commonly show decreases in the subtropics
and the Mediterranean region, but there are increases in
East Africa, central Asia and some other regions with increased
precipitation. Decreases also occur at high latitudes, where
snow cover diminishes (Section 2.3.2). While the magnitude
of changes is often uncertain, there is consistency in the sign
of change in many of these regions. Similar patterns of change
occur in seasonal results. [WGI 10.3.2.3]
2.3.6 Runoff and river discharge
Changes in river flows, as well as lake and wetland levels, due
to climate change depend primarily on changes in the volume
and timing of precipitation and, crucially, whether precipitation
falls as snow or rain. Changes in evaporation also affect river
flows. Several hundred studies of the potential effects of climate
change on river flows have been published in scientific journals,
and many more studies have been presented in internal reports.
Studies are heavily focused towards Europe, North America
and Australasia, with a small number of studies from Asia.
Virtually all studies use a catchment hydrological model driven
by scenarios based on climate model simulations, and almost all
are at the catchment scale. The few global-scale studies that have
been conducted using both runoff simulated directly by climate
models [WGI 10.3.2.3] and hydrological models run off-line
[WGII 3.4] show that runoff increases in high latitudes and the
wet tropics, and decreases in mid-latitudes and some parts of
the dry tropics. Figure 2.8c shows the ensemble mean runoff
change under the A1B scenario. Runoff is notably reduced in
southern Europe and increased in south-east Asia and in high
latitudes, where there is consistency among models in the sign
of change (although less in the magnitude of change). The larger
changes reach 20% or more of the simulated 1980–1999 values,
which range from 1 to 5 mm/day in wetter regions to below
0.2 mm/day in deserts. Flows in high-latitude rivers increase,
while those from major rivers in the Middle East, Europe
and Central America tend to decrease. [WGI 10.3.2.3] The
magnitude of change, however, varies between climate models
and, in some regions such as southern Asia, runoff could either
increase or decrease. As indicated in Section 2.2.1, the effects
of CO2 enrichment may lead to reduced evaporation, and hence
either greater increases or smaller decreases in the volume of
runoff. [WGI 7.2]
Figure 2.10 shows the change in annual runoff for 2090–2099
compared with 1980–1999. Values represent the median of
12 climate models using the SRES A1B scenario. Hatching
and whitening are used to mark areas where models agree or
disagree, respectively, on the sign of change: note the large
areas where the direction of change is uncertain. This global
map of annual runoff illustrates large-scale changes and is not
intended to be interpreted at small temporal (e.g., seasonal) and
30
Observed and projected changes in climate as they relate to water Section 2
spatial scales. In areas where rainfall and runoff are very low
(e.g., desert areas), small changes in runoff can lead to large
percentage changes. In some regions, the sign of projected
changes in runoff differs from recently observed trends (Section
2.1.6). In some areas with projected increases in runoff, different
seasonal effects are expected, such as increased wet-season
runoff and decreased dry-season runoff. [WGII 3.4.1]
A very robust finding is that warming would lead to changes in
the seasonality of river flows where much winter precipitation
currently falls as snow, with spring flows decreasing because of
the reduced or earlier snowmelt, and winter flows increasing.
This has been found in the European Alps, Scandinavia and
around the Baltic, Russia, the Himalayas, and western, central
and eastern North America. The effect is greatest at lower
elevations, where snowfall is more marginal, and in many cases
peak flows by the middle of the 21st century would occur at least
a month earlier. In regions with little or no snowfall, changes in
runoff are much more dependent on changes in rainfall than on
changes in temperature. Most studies in such regions project an
increase in the seasonality of flows, often with higher flows in
the peak flow season and either lower flows during the low-flow
season or extended dry periods. [WGII 3.4.1]
Many rivers draining glaciated regions, particularly in the
Asian high mountain ranges and the South American Andes, are
sustained by glacier melt during warm and dry periods. Retreat
of these glaciers due to global warming would lead to increased
river flows in the short term, but the contribution of glacier melt
would gradually fall over the next few decades. [WGII 3.4.1]
Changes in lake levels reflect changes in the seasonal distribution
of river inflows, precipitation and evaporation, in some cases
integrated over many years. Lakes may therefore respond in
a very non-linear way to a linear change in inputs. Studies of
the Great Lakes of North America and the Caspian Sea suggest
changes in water levels of the order of several tens of centimetres,
and sometimes metres, by the end of the century. [WGII 3.4.1]

where less than 66% of the ensemble of 12 models agree on the sign of change, and hatched areas are where more than 90%
of models agree on the sign of change (Milly et al., 2005). [Based on SYR Figure 3.5 and WGII Figure 3.4]

Section 2 Observed and projected changes in climate as they relate to water
2.3.7 Patterns of large-scale variability
Based on the global climate models assessed in AR4, sea-level
pressure is projected to increase over the sub-tropics and midlatitudes,
and to decrease over high latitudes. These changes
are associated with an expansion of the Hadley Circulation and
positive trends in the Northern Annular Mode/North Atlantic
Oscillation (NAM/NAO) and the Southern Annular Mode
(SAM). As a result of these changes, storm tracks are projected
to move polewards, with consequent changes in wind,
precipitation and temperature patterns outside the tropics,
continuing the broad pattern of observed trends over the last
half-century. [WGI TS, 10.3.5.6, 10.3.6.4]
It is likely that future tropical cyclones will become more intense,
with larger peak wind speeds and heavier precipitation, associated
with ongoing increases of tropical SSTs. [WGI SPM, 10.3.6.3]
SSTs in the central and eastern equatorial Pacific are projected
to warm more than those in the western equatorial Pacific,
with a corresponding mean eastward shift in precipitation.
All models show continued El Niño–Southern Oscillation
(ENSO) interannual variability in the future, but large intermodel
differences in projected changes in El Niño amplitude,
and the inherent multi-decadal time-scale variability of El
Niño in the models, preclude a definitive projection of trends
in ENSO variability. [WGI TS, 10.3.5.3, 10.3.5.4]
Interannual variability in monthly mean surface air
temperature is projected to decrease during the cold season
in the extra-tropical Northern Hemisphere and to increase at
low latitudes and warm-season northern mid-latitudes. The
former is probably due to the decrease in sea ice and snow
with increasing temperature. The summer decrease in soil
moisture over the mid-latitude land surfaces contributes to
the latter. Monthly mean precipitation variability is projected
to increase in most areas, both in absolute value (standard
deviation) and in relative value (coefficient of variation).
However, the significance level of these projected variability
changes is low. [WGI 10.3.5.1]

resources: impacts and responses

Section 3 Linking climate change and water resources: impacts and responses
3.1 Observed climate change impacts
3.1.1 Observed effects due to changes in the
cryosphere
Effects of changes in the cryosphere have been documented in
relation to virtually all cryospheric components, with robust
evidence that they are, in general, a response to the reduction of
snow and ice masses due to enhanced warming.
3.1.1.1 Mountain glaciers and ice caps, ice sheets and ice
shelves
Effects of changes in mountain glaciers and ice caps have been
documented in runoff (Kaser et al., 2003; Box et al., 2006),
changing hazard conditions (Haeberli and Burn, 2002) and
ocean freshening (Bindoff et al., 2007). There is also emerging
evidence of present crustal uplift in response to recent glacier
melting in Alaska (Larsen et al., 2005). The enhanced melting,
as well as the increased length of the melt season of glaciers,
leads at first to increased river runoff and discharge peaks, while
in the longer time-frame (decadal to century scale), glacier
runoff is expected to decrease (Jansson et al., 2003). Evidence
for increased runoff in recent decades due to enhanced glacier
melt has already been detected in the tropical Andes and in the
Alps. [WGI 4.6.2; WGII 1.3.1.1]
The formation of lakes is occurring as glaciers retreat from
prominent Little Ice Age (LIA) moraines in several steep
mountain ranges, including the Himalayas (see Box 5.4), the
Andes and the Alps. Thawing of buried ice also threatens to
destabilise the Little Ice Age moraines. These lakes thus have
a high potential for glacial lake outburst floods (GLOFs).
Governmental institutions in the respective countries have
undertaken extensive safety work, and several of the lakes are
now either solidly dammed or drained; but continued vigilance
is needed, since many tens of potentially dangerous glacial
lakes still exist in the Himalayas (Yamada, 1998) and the Andes
(Ames, 1998), together with several more in other mountain
ranges of the world. [WGII 1.3.1.1]
Glacier retreat causes striking changes in the landscape, which
has affected living conditions and local tourism in many mountain
regions around the world (Watson and Haeberli, 2004; Mölg et
al., 2005). Figure 5.10 shows the effects of the retreat of the
Chacaltaya Glacier on the local landscape and skiing industry.
Warming produces an enhanced spring–summer melting of
glaciers, particularly in areas of ablation, with a corresponding
loss of seasonal snow cover that results in increased exposure
of surface crevasses, which can in turn affect, for example,
snow runway operations, as has been reported in the Antarctic
Peninsula (Rivera et al., 2005). [WGII 1.3.1.1]
3.1.1.2 Snow cover and frozen ground
Due to less extended snow cover both in space and time, spring
peak river flows have been occurring 1–2 weeks earlier during
the last 65 years in North America and northern Eurasia. There
is also evidence for an increase in winter base flow in northern
Eurasia and North America, as well as a measured trend
towards less snow at low altitudes, which is affecting skiing
areas. [WGII 1.3.1.1]
Reductions in the extent of seasonally frozen ground and
permafrost, and an increase in active-layer thickness, have
resulted in:
the disappearance of lakes due to draining within the
permafrost, as detected in Alaska (Yoshikawa and Hinzman,
2003) and Siberia (see Figure 5.12) (Smith et al., 2005);
a decrease in potential travel days of vehicles over frozen
roads in Alaska;
increased coastal erosion in the Arctic (e.g., Beaulieu and
Allard, 2003).
[WGII 1.3.1.1, Chapter 15]
3.1.2 Hydrology and water resources
3.1.2.1 Changes in surface and groundwater systems
Since the TAR there have been many studies related to trends
in river flows during the 20th century at scales ranging from
catchment to global. Some of these studies have detected
significant trends in some indicators of river flow, and some
have demonstrated statistically significant links with trends
in temperature or precipitation; but no globally homogeneous
trend has been reported. Many studies, however, have found no
trends, or have been unable to separate the effects of variations
in temperature and precipitation from the effects of human
interventions in the catchment, such as land-use change and
reservoir construction. Variation in river flows from year to year
is also very strongly influenced in some regions by large-scale
atmospheric circulation patterns associated with ENSO, NAO
and other variability systems that operate at within-decadal and
multi-decadal time-scales. [WGII 1.3.2.1]
At the global scale, there is evidence of a broadly coherent
pattern of change in annual runoff, with some regions
experiencing an increase (Tao et al., 2003a, b, for China;
Hyvarinen, 2003, for Finland; Walter et al., 2004, for the
coterminous USA), particularly at higher latitudes, and others a
decrease, for example in parts of West Africa, southern Europe
and southern Latin America (Milly et al., 2005). Labat et al.
(2004) claimed a 4% increase in global total runoff per 1°C
rise in temperature during the 20th century, with regional
variation around this trend, but this has been challenged due
to the effects of non-climatic drivers on runoff and bias due to
the small number of data points (Legates et al., 2005). Gedney
et al. (2006) gave the first tentative evidence that CO2 forcing
leads to increases in runoff due to the effects of elevated CO2
concentrations on plant physiology, although other evidence for
such a relationship is difficult to find. The methodology used
to search for trends can also influence results, since omitting
the effects of cross-correlation between river catchments can
lead to an overestimation of the number of catchments showing
significant trends (Douglas et al., 2000). [WGII 1.3.2.1]

Linking climate change and water resources: impacts and responses Section 3
Groundwater flow in shallow aquifers is part of the hydrological
cycle and is affected by climate variability and change through
recharge processes (Chen et al., 2002), as well as by human
interventions in many locations (Petheram et al., 2001). [WGII
1.3.2.1] Groundwater levels of many aquifers around the world
show a decreasing trend over the last few decades [WGII 3.2,
10.4.2], but this is generally due to groundwater pumping
surpassing groundwater recharge rates, and not to a climaterelated
decrease in groundwater recharge. There may be regions,
such as south-western Australia, where increased groundwater
withdrawals have been caused not only by increased water
demand but also because of a climate-related decrease in
recharge from surface water supplies (Government of Western
Australia, 2003). In the upper carbonate aquifer near Winnipeg,
Canada, shallow well hydrographs show no obvious trends,
but exhibit variations of 3–4 years correlated with changes in
annual temperature and precipitation (Ferguson and George,
2003). Owing to a lack of data and the very slow reaction of
groundwater systems to changing recharge conditions, climaterelated
changes in groundwater recharges have not been
observed. [WGII 1.3.2, 3.2]
At present, no globally consistent trend in lake levels has been
found. While some lake levels have risen in Mongolia and China
(Xinjiang) in response to increased snow- and ice melt, other
lake levels in China (Qinghai), Australia, Africa (Zimbabwe,
Zambia and Malawi), North America (North Dakota) and
Europe (central Italy) have declined due to the combined
effects of drought, warming and human activities. Within
permafrost areas in the Arctic, recent warming has resulted in
the temporary formation of lakes due to the onset of melting,
which then drain rapidly due to permafrost degradation (e.g.,
Smith et al., 2005). A similar effect has been reported for a lake
formed over an Arctic ice shelf (i.e., an epishelf lake12), which
disappeared when the ice shelf collapsed (Mueller et al., 2003).
Permafrost and epishelf lakes are treated in detail by Le Treut
et al. (2007). [WGII 1.3.2.1]
3.1.2.2 Water quality
A climate-related warming of lakes and rivers has been observed
over recent decades. [WGII 1.3.2] As a result, freshwater
ecosystems have shown changes in species composition,
organism abundance, productivity and phenological shifts
(including earlier fish migration). [WGII 1.3.4] Also due to
warming, many lakes have exhibited prolonged stratification
with decreases in surface layer nutrient concentration [WGII
1.3.2], and prolonged depletion of oxygen in deeper layers.
[WGII Box 4.1] Due to strong anthropogenic impacts not
related to climate change, there is no evidence for consistent
climate-related trends in other water quality parameters (e.g.,
salinity, pathogens or nutrients) in lakes, rivers and groundwater.
[WGII 3.2]
Thermal structure of lakes
Higher water temperatures have been reported in lakes in
response to warmer conditions (Table 3.1). Shorter periods
of ice cover and decreases in river- and lake-ice thickness are
treated in Section 2.1.2 and Le Treut et al. (2007). Phytoplankton
dynamics and primary productivity have also been altered in
conjunction with changes in lake physics. [WGII 1.3.4.4, Figure
1.2, Table 1.6] Since the 1960s, surface water temperatures
have warmed by between 0.2 and 2.0°C in lakes and rivers
in Europe, North America and Asia. Along with warming
surface waters, deep-water temperatures (which reflect longterm
trends) of the large East African lakes (Edward, Albert,
Kivu, Victoria, Tanganyika and Malawi) have warmed by
between 0.2 and 0.7°C since the early 1900s. Increased water
temperature and longer ice-free seasons influence the thermal
stratification and internal hydrodynamics of lakes. In warmer
years, surface water temperatures are higher, evaporative water
loss increases, summer stratification occurs earlier in the season,
and thermoclines become shallower. In several lakes in Europe
and North America, the stratified period has advanced by up to
20 days and lengthened by 2–3 weeks, with increased thermal
stability. [WGII 1.3.2.3]
Chemistry
Increased stratification reduces water movement across the
thermocline, inhibiting the upwelling and mixing that provide
essential nutrients to the food web. There have been decreases
in nutrients in the surface water and corresponding increases
in deep-water concentrations of European and East African
lakes because of reduced upwelling due to greater thermal
stability. Many lakes and rivers have increased concentrations
of sulphates, base cations and silica, and greater alkalinity and
conductivity related to increased weathering of silicates, calcium
and magnesium sulphates, or carbonates, in their catchment.
In contrast, when warmer temperatures enhanced vegetative
growth and soil development in some high-alpine ecosystems,
alkalinity decreased because of increased organic acid inputs
(Karst-Riddoch et al., 2005). Glacial melting increased the
input of organochlorines (which had been atmospherically
transported to and stored in the glacier) to a sub-alpine lake in
Canada (Blais et al., 2001). [WGII 1.3.2.3]
Increased temperature also affects in-lake chemical processes
(Table 3.1; see also WGII Table SM1.3 for additional observed
changes in chemical water properties). There have been decreases
in dissolved inorganic nitrogen from greater phytoplankton
productivity (Sommaruga-Wograth et al., 1997; Rogora et al.,
2003) and greater in-lake alkalinity generation and increases in
pH in soft-water lakes (Psenner and Schmidt, 1992). Decreased
solubility from higher temperatures significantly contributed to
11–13% of the decrease in aluminium concentration (Vesely et
al., 2003), whereas lakes that had warmer water temperatures
had increased mercury methylation and higher mercury levels
in fish (Bodaly et al., 1993). A decrease in silicon content related
to regional warming has been documented in Lake Baikal,
Russia. River water-quality data from 27 rivers in Japan also
suggest a deterioration in both chemical and biological features
due to increases in air temperature. [WGII 1.3.2.3]

Section 3 Linking climate change and water resources: impacts and responses
Erosion and sedimentation
Water erosion has increased in many areas of the world, largely
as a consequence of anthropogenic land-use change. Due to lack
of data, there is no evidence for or against past climate-related
changes in erosion and sediment transport. [WGII 3.2]
3.1.2.3 Floods
A variety of climatic and non-climatic processes influence flood
processes, resulting in river floods, flash floods, urban floods,
sewer floods, glacial lake outburst floods (GLOFs, see Box 5.4)
and coastal floods. These flood-producing processes include
intense and/or long-lasting precipitation, snowmelt, dam break,
reduced conveyance due to ice jams or landslides, or by storm.
Floods depend on precipitation intensity, volume, timing,
phase (rain or snow), antecedent conditions of rivers and their
drainage basins (e.g., presence of snow and ice, soil character
and status (frozen or not, saturated or unsaturated), wetness,
rate and timing of snow/ice melt, urbanisation, existence of
dykes, dams and reservoirs). Human encroachment into flood
plains and lack of flood response plans increase the damage
potential. [WGII 3.4.3] The observed increase in precipitation
intensity and other observed climate changes, e.g., an increase
in westerly weather patterns during winter over Europe, leading
to very rainy low-pressure systems that often trigger floods
(Kron and Berz, 2007), indicate that climate change might
already have had an impact on the intensity and frequency of
floods. [WGII 3.2] The Working Group I AR4 Summary for
Policymakers concluded that it is likely that the frequency of
heavy precipitation events has increased over most areas during
the late 20th century, and that it is more likely than not that
there has been a human contribution to this trend. [WGI Table
SPM-2]
Globally, the number of great inland flood catastrophes during
the last 10 years (1996–2005) is twice as large, per decade, as
between 1950 and 1980, while related economic losses have
increased by a factor of five (Kron and Berz, 2007). Dominant
drivers of the upward trend of flood damage are socio-economic
factors such as economic growth, increases in population and
in the wealth concentrated in vulnerable areas, and land-use
change. Floods have been the most reported natural disaster
events in many regions, affecting 140 million people per year
on average (WDR, 2003, 2004). In Bangladesh, during the 1998
flood, about 70% of the country’s area was inundated (compared
to an average value of 20–25%) (Mirza, 2003; Clarke and King,
2004). [WGII 3.2]
Since flood damages have grown more rapidly than population
or economic growth, other factors must be considered, including
climate change (Mills, 2005). The weight of observational
evidence indicates an ongoing acceleration of the water cycle
(Huntington, 2006). [WGII 3.4.3] The frequency of heavy
precipitation events has increased, consistent with both
warming and observed increases in atmospheric water vapour.
[WGI SPM, 3.8, 3.9] However, no ubiquitous increase is visible
in documented trends in high river flows. Although Milly et al.

(2002) identified an apparent increase in the frequency of ‘large’
floods (return period >100 years) across much of the globe
from the analysis of data from large river basins, subsequent
studies have provided less widespread evidence. Kundzewicz
et al. (2005) found increases (in 27 locations) and decreases
(in 31 locations) and no trend in the remaining 137 of the 195
catchments examined worldwide. [WGII 1.3.2.2]
3.1.2.4 Droughts
The term drought may refer to a meteorological drought
(precipitation well below average), hydrological drought
(low river flows and low water levels in rivers, lakes and
groundwater), agricultural drought (low soil moisture), and
environmental drought (a combination of the above). The socioeconomic
impacts of droughts may arise from the interaction
between natural conditions and human factors such as changes
in land use, land cover, and the demand for and use of water.
Excessive water withdrawals can exacerbate the impact of
drought. [WGII 3.4.3]
Droughts have become more common, especially in the tropics
and sub-tropics, since the 1970s. The Working Group I AR4
Summary for Policymakers concluded that it is likely that the
area affected by drought has increased since the 1970s, and it
is more likely than not that there is a human contribution to this
trend. [WGI Table SPM-2] Decreased land precipitation and
increased temperatures, which enhance evapotranspiration and
reduce soil moisture, are important factors that have contributed
to more regions experiencing droughts, as measured by the
Palmer Drought Severity Index (PDSI) (Dai et al., 2004b).
[WGII 3.3.4]
The regions where droughts have occurred seem to be determined
largely by changes in sea surface temperatures, especially in
the tropics, through associated changes in the atmospheric
circulation and precipitation. In the western USA, diminishing
snow pack and subsequent reductions in soil moisture also
appear to be factors. In Australia and Europe, direct links to
global warming have been inferred through the extreme nature
of high temperatures and heatwaves accompanying recent
droughts. [WGI 3.ES, 3.3.4]
Using the PDSI, Dai et al. (2004b) found a large drying trend
over Northern Hemisphere land since the mid-1950s, with
widespread drying over much of Eurasia, northern Africa,
Canada and Alaska (Figure 3.1). In the Southern Hemisphere,
land surfaces were wet in the 1970s and relatively dry in the
1960s and 1990s, and there was a drying trend from 1974 to
1998, although trends over the entire 1948 to 2002 period were
small. Decreases in land precipitation in recent decades are the
main cause for the drying trends, although large surface warming
during the last 2–3 decades is likely to have contributed to the
drying. Globally, very dry areas (defined as land areas with a
PDSI of less than −3.0) more than doubled (from ~12% to 30%)
since the 1970s, with a large jump in the early 1980s due to an
ENSO-related precipitation decrease over land, and subsequent
increases primarily due to surface warming (Dai et al., 2004b).
[WGI 3.3.4]
Droughts affect rain-fed agricultural production as well as
water supply for domestic, industrial and agricultural purposes.
Some semi-arid and sub-humid regions, e.g., Australia. [WGII
11.2.1], western USA and southern Canada [WGII 14.2.1], and
the Sahel (Nicholson, 2005), have suffered from more intense
and multi-annual droughts. [WGII 3.2]
The 2003 heatwave in Europe, attributable to global warming
(Schär et al., 2004), was accompanied by annual precipitation
deficits up to 300 mm. This drought contributed to the estimated
30% reduction in gross primary production of terrestrial
ecosystems over Europe (Ciais et al., 2005). Many major rivers
(e.g., the Po, Rhine, Loire and Danube) were at record low
levels, resulting in disruption of inland navigation, irrigation
and power plant cooling (Beniston and Diaz, 2004; Zebisch et
al., 2005). The extreme glacier melt in the Alps prevented even
lower flows of the Danube and Rhine Rivers (Fink et al., 2004).
[WGII 12.6.1]
3.2 Future changes in water availability
iiiiiiiand demand due to climate change
3.2.1 Climate-related drivers of freshwater
iiiiiiiiiiiiiiiisystems in the future
The most dominant climate drivers for water availability are
precipitation, temperature and evaporative demand (determined
by net radiation at the ground, atmospheric humidity and wind
speed, and temperature). Temperature is particularly important
in snow-dominated basins and in coastal areas, the latter due to
the impact of temperature on sea level (steric sea-level rise due
to thermal expansion of water). [WGII 3.3.1]
Projected changes in these components of the water balance are
described in Section 2.3. In short, the total annual river runoff
over the whole land surface is projected to increase, even
though there are regions with significant increase and significant
decrease in runoff. However, increased runoff cannot be fully
utilised unless there is adequate infrastructure to capture and
store the extra water. Over the oceans, a net increase in the term
‘evaporation minus precipitation’ is projected.
3.2.1.1 Groundwater
Climate change affects groundwater recharge rates (i.e., the
renewable groundwater resources) and depths of groundwater
tables. However, knowledge of current recharge and levels in
both developed and developing countries is poor; and there has
been very little research on the future impact of climate change
on groundwater, or groundwater–surface water interactions. At
high latitudes, thawing of permafrost causes changes in both
the level and quality of groundwater, due to increased coupling
with surface waters. [WGII 15.4.1] As many groundwaters
both change into and are recharged from surface water,
impacts of surface water flow regimes are expected to affect
groundwater. Increased precipitation variability may decrease
groundwater recharge in humid areas because more frequent
39
Section 3 Linking climate change and water resources: impacts and responses
13 Note that the PDSI does not realistically model drought in regions where precipitation is held in the snowpack, for example, in polar regions.
Figure 3.1: The most important spatial pattern (the first component of a principal components analysis; top) of the monthly
Palmer Drought Severity Index (PDSI) for 1900 to 2002. The PDSI is a prominent index of drought and measures the cumulative
deficit (relative to local mean conditions) in surface land moisture by incorporating previous precipitation and estimates of
moisture drawn into the atmosphere (based on atmospheric temperatures) into a hydrological accounting system.13 The lower
panel shows how the sign and strength of this pattern has changed since 1900. When the values shown in the lower plot are
positive (or negative), the red and orange areas in the upper map are drier (or wetter) and the blue and green areas are wetter
(or drier) than average. The smooth black curve shows decadal variations. The time-series approximately corresponds to a
trend, and this pattern and its variations account for 67% of the linear trend of PDSI from 1900 to 2002 over the global land
area. It therefore features widespread increasing African drought, especially in the Sahel, for instance. Note also the wetter
areas, especially in eastern North and South America and northern Eurasia (after Dai et al., 2004b). [WGI FAQ 3.2]
40
Linking climate change and water resources: impacts and responses Section 3
heavy precipitation events may result in the infiltration capacity
of the soil being exceeded more often. In semi-arid and arid
areas, however, increased precipitation variability may increase
groundwater recharge, because only high-intensity rainfalls are
able to infiltrate fast enough before evaporating, and alluvial
aquifers are recharged mainly by inundations due to floods.
[WGII 3.4.2]
According to the results of a global hydrological model (see
Figure 3.2), groundwater recharge, when averaged globally,
increases less than total runoff (by 2% as compared with 9%
until the 2050s for the ECHAM4 climate change response to the
SRES A2 scenario: Döll and Flörke, 2005). For all four climate
change scenarios investigated (the ECHAM4 and HadCM3
GCMs with the SRES A2 and B2 emissions scenarios14),
groundwater recharge was computed to decrease by the 2050s
by more than 70% in north-eastern Brazil, south-western Africa
and the southern rim of the Mediterranean Sea. However, as
this study did not take account of an expected increase in the
variability of daily precipitation, the decrease might be somewhat
overestimated. Where the depth of the water table increases and
groundwater recharge declines, wetlands dependent on aquifers
are jeopardised and the base flow runoff in rivers during dry
seasons is reduced. Regions in which groundwater recharge is

and HadCM3 climate models and the SRES A2 and B2 emissions scenarios) (Döll and Flörke, 2005). [WGII Figure 3.5]

computed to increase by more than 30% by the 2050s include
the Sahel, the Near East, northern China, Siberia and the western
USA. In areas where water tables are already high, increased
recharge might cause problems in towns and agricultural areas
through soil salinisation and waterlogged soils. [WGII 3.4.2]
The few studies of climate change impacts on groundwater
for individual aquifers show very site-specific and climatemodel-
specific results (e.g., Eckhardt and Ulbrich, 2003, for
a low mountain range catchment in Central Europe; Brouyere
et al., 2004, for a chalk aquifer in Belgium). For example, in
the Ogallala Aquifer region, projected natural groundwater
recharge decreases more than 20% in all simulations with
warming of 2.5°C or greater (Rosenberg et al., 1999). [WGII
14.4] As a result of climate change, in many aquifers of the
world the spring recharge shifts towards winter and summer
recharge declines. [WGII 3.4.2]
3.2.1.2 Floods
As discussed in Section 2.3.1, heavy precipitation events
are projected to become more frequent over most regions
throughout the 21st century. This would affect the risk of flash
flooding and urban flooding. [WGI 10.3.5, 10.3.6; WGII 3.4.3]
Some potential impacts are shown in Table 3.2.
In a multi-model analysis, Palmer and Räisänen (2002)
projected a considerable increase in the risk of a very wet
winter over much of central and northern Europe, this being
due to an increase in intense precipitation associated with
mid-latitude storms. The probability of total boreal winter
precipitation exceeding two standard deviations above normal
was projected to increase considerably (five- to seven-fold)
for a CO2-doubling over large areas of Europe, with likely
consequences for winter flood hazard. An increase in the risk
of a very wet monsoon season in Asia was also projected
(Palmer and Räisänen, 2002). According to Milly et al.
(2002), for 15 out of 16 large basins worldwide, the control
100-year peak volumes of monthly river flow are projected to
be exceeded more frequently for a CO2-quadrupling. In some
areas, what is given as a 100-year flood now (in the control
run), is projected to occur much more frequently, even every
2–5 years, albeit with a large uncertainty in these projections.
In many temperate regions, the contribution of snowmelt to
spring floods is likely to decline (Zhang et al., 2005). [WGII
3.4.3]
Based on climate models, the area flooded in Bangladesh
is projected to increase by at least 23–29% with a global
temperature rise of 2°C (Mirza, 2003). [WGII 3.4.3]

Warming-induced reduction of firn15 cover on glaciers causes
enhanced and immediate runoff of melt water and can lead to
flooding of glacial-fed rivers. [WGII 3.4.3]
There is a degree of uncertainty in estimates of future changes
in flood frequency across the UK. Depending on which climate
model is used, and on the importance of snowmelt contribution
and catchment characteristics and location, the impact of climate
change on the flood regime (magnitude and frequency) can be
positive or negative, highlighting the uncertainty still remaining
in climate change impacts (Reynard et al., 2004). [WGII 3.4.3]
3.2.1.3 Droughts
It is likely that the area affected by drought will increase. [WGI
SPM] There is a tendency for drying of mid-continental areas
during summer, indicating a greater risk of droughts in these
regions. [WGI 10.ES] In a single-model study of global drought
frequency, the proportion of the land surface experiencing
extreme drought at any one time, the frequency of extreme
drought events, and the mean drought duration, were projected
to increase by 10- to 30-fold, two-fold, and six-fold, respectively,
by the 2090s, for the SRES A2 scenario (Burke et al., 2006).
[WGI 10.3.6; WGII 3.4.3] A decrease in summer precipitation in
southern and central Europe, accompanied by rising temperatures
(which enhance evaporative demand), would inevitably lead
to both reduced summer soil moisture (cf. Douville et al.,
2002; Christensen et al., 2007) and more frequent and intense
droughts. [WGII 3.4.3] As shown in Figure 3.3, by the 2070s, a
100-year drought16 of today’s magnitude is projected to return,
on average, more frequently than every 10 years in parts of
Spain and Portugal, western France, Poland’s Vistula Basin and
western Turkey (Lehner et al., 2005). [WGII 3.4.3]

Section 3 Linking climate change and water resources: impacts and responses
Some impacts of increased drought area are shown in Table
3.2. Snowmelt is projected to become earlier and less abundant
in the melt period, and this may increase the risk of droughts
in snowmelt-fed basins in the low-flow season – summer and
autumn. An increase in drought risk is projected for regions
which depend heavily on glacial melt water for their main
dry-season water supply (Barnett et al., 2005). In the Andes,
glacial melt water supports river flow and water supply for
tens of millions of people during the long dry season. Many
small glaciers, e.g., in Bolivia, Ecuador and Peru (cf. Ramírez
et al., 2001; Box 5.5), are expected to disappear within the
next few decades. Water supply in areas fed by glacial and
snow melt water from the Hindu Kush and Himalayas, on
which hundreds of millions of people in China, Pakistan and
India depend, will be adversely affected (Barnett et al., 2005).
[WGII 3.4.3]
3.2.1.4 Water quality
Higher water temperatures, increased precipitation intensity,
and longer periods of low flows are projected to exacerbate
many forms of water pollution, including sediments, nutrients,
dissolved organic carbon, pathogens, pesticides, salt and
thermal pollution. This will promote algal blooms (Hall et
al., 2002; Kumagai et al., 2003), and increase the bacterial
and fungal content (Environment Canada, 2001). This will, in
turn, impact ecosystems, human health, and the reliability and
operating costs of water systems. [WGII 3.ES]
Rising temperatures are likely to lower water quality in lakes
through increased thermal stability and altered mixing patterns,
resulting in reduced oxygen concentrations and an increased
release of phosphorus from the sediments. For example, already
high phosphorus concentrations during summer in a bay of
Lake Ontario could double with a 3–4°C increase in water
temperature (Nicholls, 1999). However, rising temperatures
can also improve water quality during winter/spring due to
earlier ice break-up and consequent higher oxygen levels and
reduced winter fish-kill. [WGII 4.4.8, 14.4.1]
More intense rainfall will lead to an increase in suspended
solids (turbidity) in lakes and reservoirs due to soil fluvial
erosion (Leemans and Kleidon, 2002), and pollutants will be
introduced (Mimikou et al., 2000; Neff et al., 2000; Bouraoui
et al., 2004). The projected increase in precipitation intensity
is expected to lead to a deterioration of water quality, as it
results in the enhanced transport of pathogens and other
dissolved pollutants (e.g., pesticides) to surface waters and
groundwater; and in increased erosion, which in turn leads to
the mobilisation of adsorbed pollutants such as phosphorus
and heavy metals. In addition, more frequent heavy rainfall
events will overload the capacity of sewer systems and water
and wastewater treatment plants more often. [WGII 3.4.4]
An increased occurrence of low flows will lead to decreased
contaminant dilution capacity, and thus higher pollutant
concentrations, including pathogens. [WGII 3.4.4, 14.4.1] In
areas with overall decreased runoff (e.g., in many semi-arid
areas), water quality deterioration will be even worse.
In semi-arid and arid areas, climate change is likely to
increase salinisation of shallow groundwater due to increased
evapotranspiration. [WGII 3.4.2] As streamflow is projected
to decrease in many semi-arid areas, the salinity of rivers and
estuaries will increase. [WGII 3.4.4] For example, salinity levels
in the headwaters of the Murray-Darling Basin in Australia
are expected to increase by 13–19% by 2050 (Pittock, 2003).
In general, decreased groundwater recharge, which reduces
mobilisation of underground salt, may balance the effect of
decreased dilution of salts in rivers and estuaries. [WGII 11.4]
In coastal areas, rising sea levels may have negative effects
on storm-water drainage and sewage disposal [WGII 3.4.4]
and increase the potential for the intrusion of saline water into
fresh groundwater in coastal aquifers, thus adversely affecting
groundwater resources. [WGII 3.4.2] For two small and flat
coral islands off the coast of India, the thickness of freshwater
lenses was computed to decrease from 25 m to 10 m and from
36 m to 28 m, respectively, for a sea-level rise of only 0.1 m
(Bobba et al., 2000). Any decrease in groundwater recharge
will exacerbate the effect of sea-level rise. In inland aquifers,
a decrease in groundwater recharge can lead to saltwater
intrusion from neighbouring saline aquifers (Chen et al., 2004).
[WGII 3.4.2]
3.2.1.5 Water erosion and sedimentation
All studies on soil erosion show that the expected increase in
rainfall intensity would lead to greater rates of erosion. [WGII
3.4.5] In addition, the shift of winter precipitation from less
erosive snow to more erosive rainfall due to increasing winter
temperatures enhances erosion, with this leading, for example,
to negative water quality impacts in agricultural areas.
[WGII 3.4.5, 14.4.1]
The melting of permafrost induces an erodible state in soil which
was previously non-erodible. [WGII 3.4.5] Further indirect
impacts of climate change on erosion are related to soil and
vegetation changes caused by climate change and associated
adaptation actions. [WGII 3.4.5] The very few studies on
the impact of climate change on sediment transport suggest
transport enhancement due to increased erosion, particularly in
areas with increased runoff. [WGII 3.4.5]
3.2.2 Non-climatic drivers of freshwater systems
iiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiin the future
Many non-climatic drivers affect freshwater resources at the
global scale (UN, 2003). Both the quantity and quality of water
resources are influenced by land-use change, construction and
management of reservoirs, pollutant emissions and water
and wastewater treatment. Water use is driven by changes
in population, food consumption, economy (including water
pricing), technology, lifestyle and societal views regarding
the value of freshwater ecosystems. The vulnerability of
freshwater systems to climate change also depends on national
and international water management. It can be expected that
44
Linking climate change and water resources: impacts and responses Section 3
the paradigm of ‘integrated water resources management’
(IWRM)17 will be followed increasingly around the world
(UN, 2002; World Bank, 2004a; World Water Council, 2006),
and that such a movement has the potential to position water
issues, both as a resource and an ecosystem, at the centre of the
policy-making arena. This is likely to decrease the vulnerability
of freshwater systems to climate change. Consideration of
environmental flow requirements may lead to the modification
of reservoir operations so that human use of these water
resources might be restricted. [WGII 3.3.2]
3.2.3 Impacts of climate change on freshwater
availability in the future
With respect to water supply, it is very likely that the costs of
climate change will outweigh the benefits globally. One reason is
that precipitation variability is very likely to increase, and more
frequent floods and droughts are anticipated, as discussed in
Sections 2.1.6 and 2.3.1. The risk of droughts in snowmelt-fed
basins in the low-flow season will increase, as discussed in Section
3.2.1. The impacts of floods and droughts could be tempered by
appropriate infrastructure investments and by changes in water
and land-use management, but the implementation of such
measures will entail costs (US Global Change Research Program,
2000). Water infrastructure, usage patterns and institutions have
developed in the context of current conditions. Any substantial
change in the frequency of floods and droughts, or in the quantity
and quality or seasonal timing of water availability, will require
adjustments that may be costly, not only in monetary terms but
also in terms of societal and ecological impacts, including the
need to manage potential conflicts between different interest
groups (Miller et al., 1997). [WGII 3.5]
Hydrological changes may have impacts that are positive in
some aspects and negative in others. For example, increased
annual runoff may produce benefits for a variety of both instream
and out-of-stream water users by increasing renewable water
resources, but may simultaneously generate harm by increasing
flood risk. In recent decades, a trend to wetter conditions in parts
of southern South America has increased the area inundated
by floods, but has also improved crop yields in the Pampas
region of Argentina, and has provided new commercial fishing
opportunities (Magrin et al., 2005). [WGII 13.2.4] Increased
runoff could also damage areas with a shallow water table. In such
areas, a water-table rise disturbs agricultural use and damages
buildings in urban areas. In Russia, for example, the current
annual damage caused by shallow water tables is estimated to be
US$5–6 billion (Kharkina, 2004) and is likely to increase in the
future. In addition, an increase in annual runoff may not lead to
a beneficial increase in readily available water resources, if that
additional runoff is concentrated during the high-flow season.
[WGII 3.5]
Increased precipitation intensity may result in periods of
increased turbidity and nutrient and pathogen loadings to
surface water sources. The water utility serving New York City
has identified heavy precipitation events as one of its major
climate-change-related concerns because such events can raise
turbidity levels in some of the city’s main reservoirs up to 100
times the legal limit for source quality at the utility’s intake,
requiring substantial additional treatment and monitoring costs
(Miller and Yates, 2006). [WGII 3.5.1]
3.2.4 Impacts of climate change on freshwater
demand in the future
Higher temperatures and increased variability of precipitation
would, in general, lead to increased irrigation water demand,
even if the total precipitation during the growing season
remains the same. The impact of climate change on optimal
growing periods, and on yield-maximising irrigation water
use, has been modelled assuming no change in either irrigated
area and/or climate variability (Döll, 2002; Döll et al., 2003).
Applying the IPCC SRES A2 and B2 scenarios as interpreted
by two climate models, it was projected that the net irrigation
requirements of China and India, the countries with the largest
irrigated areas worldwide, would change by +2% to +15% in
the case of China, and by −6% to +5% in the case of India,
by 2020, depending on emissions scenarios and climate model
(Döll, 2002; Döll et al., 2003). Different climate models project
different worldwide changes in net irrigation requirements,
with estimated increases ranging from 1–3% by the 2020s and
2–7% by the 2070s. The largest global-scale increases in net
irrigation requirements result from a climate scenario based on
the B2 emissions scenario. [WGII 3.5.1]
In a study of maize irrigation in Illinois under profit-maximising
conditions, it was found that a 25% decrease in annual
precipitation had the same effect on irrigation profitability
as a 15% decrease combined with a doubling of the standard
deviation of daily precipitation (Eheart and Tornil, 1999). This
study also showed that profit-maximising irrigation water use
responds more strongly to changes in precipitation than does
yield-maximising water use, and that a doubling of atmospheric
CO2 has only a small effect. [WGII 3.5.1]
The increase in household water demand (for example through
an increase in garden watering) and industrial water demand, due
to climate change, is likely to be rather small, e.g., less than 5%
by the 2050s at selected locations (Mote et al., 1999; Downing
et al., 2003). An indirect, but small, secondary effect would be
increased electricity demand for the cooling of buildings, which
would tend to increase water withdrawals for the cooling of
thermal power plants. A statistical analysis of water use in New

iiiwere formulated by the International Conference on Water and the Environment in Dublin, 1992: (1) freshwater is a finite and vulnerable

iiiapproach, involving users, planners and policymakers at all levels; (3) women play a central part in the provision, management and safeguarding
iiiof water; (4) water has an economic value in all its competing uses and should be recognised as an economic good.

York City showed that daily per capita water use on days above
25°C increases by 11 litres/°C (roughly 2% of current daily per
capita use) (Protopapas et al., 2000). [WGII 3.5.1]
3.2.5 Impacts of climate change on water stress
in the future
Global estimates of the number of people living in areas with
water stress differ significantly between studies (Vörösmarty
et al., 2000; Alcamo et al., 2003a, b, 2007; Oki et al., 2003;
Arnell, 2004). Nevertheless, climate change is only one of
many factors that influence future water stress; demographic,
socio-economic and technological changes possibly play more
important roles at most time horizons and in most regions.
In the 2050s, differences in the population projections of the
four IPCC SRES scenarios would have a greater impact on
the number of people living in water-stressed river basins than
the differences in the climate scenarios (Arnell, 2004). The
number of people living in water-stressed river basins would
increase significantly (Table 3.3). The change in the number of
people expected to be under water stress after the 2050s greatly
depends on the SRES scenario adopted. A substantial increase
is projected under the A2 scenario, while the rate of increase
is lower under the A1 and B1 scenarios because of the global
increase in renewable freshwater resources and a slight decrease
in population (Oki and Kanae, 2006). It should be noted that,
using the per capita water availability indicator, climate change
would appear to reduce overall water stress at the global level.
This is because increases in runoff are concentrated heavily in
the most populous parts of the world, mainly in eastern and
south-eastern Asia. However, given that this increased runoff
occurs mainly during high-flow seasons (Arnell, 2004), it may
not alleviate dry-season problems if the extra water is not stored;
and would not ease water stress in other regions of the world.
Changes in seasonal patterns and an increasing probability
of extreme events may offset the effects of increased annual
available freshwater resources and demographic changes.
[WGII 3.5.1]
If water stress is assessed not only as a function of population and
climate change but also of changing water use, the importance
of non-climatic drivers (income, water-use efficiency, water
productivity, and industrial production) increases (Alcamo et
al., 2007). Income growth sometimes has a larger impact than
population growth on increasing water use and water stress
(when expressed as the water withdrawal: water resources
ratio). Water stress is modelled to decrease by the 2050s over
20–29% of the global land area and to increase over 62–76%
of the global land area (considering two climate models and
the SRES scenarios A2 and B2). The greater availability of
water due to increased precipitation is the principal cause of
decreasing water stress, while growing water withdrawals
are the principal cause of increasing water stress. Growth of
domestic water use, as stimulated by income growth, was found
to be dominant (Alcamo et al., 2007). [WGII 3.5.1]
3.2.6 Impacts of climate change on costs and
other socio-economic aspects of freshwater
The amount of water available for withdrawal is a function of
runoff, groundwater recharge, aquifer conditions (e.g., degree of
confinement, depth, thickness and boundaries), water quality and
water supply infrastructure (e.g., reservoirs, pumping wells and
distribution networks). Safe access to drinking water depends
more on the level of water supply infrastructure than on the
quantity of runoff. However, the goal of improved safe access to
drinking water will be harder to achieve in regions where runoff
and/or groundwater recharge decreases as a result of climate
change. In addition, climate change leads to additional costs
for the water supply sector, e.g., due to changing water levels
affecting water supply infrastructure, which might hamper the
extension of water supply services to more people. This leads,
in turn, to higher socio-economic impacts and follow-up costs,
especially in areas where the prevalence of water stress has also
increased as a result of climate change. [WGII 3.5.1]
Climate change-induced changes in both the seasonal runoff
regime and interannual runoff variability can be as important
for water availability as changes in the long-term average
annual runoff (US Global Change Research Program, 2000).
People living in snowmelt-fed basins experiencing decreasing
snow storage in winter may be negatively affected by decreased
river flows in the summer and autumn (Barnett et al., 2005). The
Rhine, for example, might suffer from a reduction of summer
low flows of 5–12% by the 2050s, which will negatively affect
water supply, particularly for thermal power plants (Middelkoop
et al., 2001). Studies for the Elbe River Basin showed that actual
evapotranspiration is projected to increase by 2050 (Krysanova
and Wechsung, 2002), while river flow, groundwater recharge,
crop yield and diffuse source pollution are likely to decrease
(Krysanova et al., 2005). [WGII 3.5.1]
In western China, earlier spring snowmelt and declining
glaciers are likely to reduce water availability for irrigated
agriculture. Investment and operation costs for the additional
wells and reservoirs which are required to guarantee a reliable
water supply under climate change have been estimated for
China. This cost is low in basins where the current water stress
is low (e.g., Changjiang) and high where water stress is high

Linking climate change and water resources: impacts and responses Section 3
(e.g., Huanghe River) (Kirshen et al., 2005a). Furthermore, the
impact of climate change on water supply cost will increase in
the future, not only because of stronger climate change, but also
due to increasing demands. [WGII 3.5.1]
For an aquifer in Texas, the net income of farmers is projected
to decrease by 16–30% by the 2030s and by 30–45% by the
2090s due to decreased irrigation water supply and increased
irrigation water demand. Net benefit in total due to water use
(dominated by municipal and industrial use) is projected to
decrease by less than 2% over the same period (Chen et al.,
2001). [WGII 3.5.1]
If freshwater supply has to be replaced by desalinated water
due to climate change, then the cost of climate change includes
the average cost of desalination, which is currently around
US$1.00/m3 for seawater and US$0.60/m3 for brackish water
(Zhou and Tol, 2005). The cost for freshwater chlorination is
approximately US$0.02/m3. In densely populated coastal areas
of Egypt, China, Bangladesh, India and south-east Asia (FAO,
2003), desalination costs may be prohibitive. In these areas,
particularly in Egypt, research in new desalination technology
is required to reduce the costs, especially with the use of nonconventional
energy sources that are associated with lower
greenhouse-gas emissions. In addition, the desalination of
brackish water can improve the economics of such projects (see
Section 4.4.4). [WGII 3.5.1]
Future flood damages will depend greatly on settlement
patterns, land-use decisions, the quality of flood forecasting,
warning and response systems, and the value of structures and
other property located in vulnerable areas (Mileti, 1999; Pielke
and Downton, 2000; Changnon, 2005), as well as on climatic
changes per se, such as changes in the frequency of tropical
cyclones (Schiermeier, 2006). [WGII 3.5.2]
The impact of climate change on flood damages can be
projected, based on modelled changes in the recurrence interval
of current 20- or 100-year floods and in conjunction with
flood damages from current events as determined from stagedischarge
relations and detailed property data. With such a
methodology, the average annual direct flood damage for three
Australian drainage basins was projected to increase four- to
ten-fold under doubled CO2 conditions (Schreider et al., 2000).
[WGII 3.5.2]
Choi and Fisher (2003) estimated the expected change in flood
damages for selected US regions under two climate change
scenarios in which mean annual precipitation increased by
13.5% and 21.5%, respectively, with the standard deviation of
annual precipitation either remaining unchanged or increasing
proportionally to the mean. Using a structural econometric
(regression) model based on a time-series of flood damage and
with population, a wealth indicator and annual precipitation as
predictors, the mean and standard deviation of flood damage
are projected to increase by more than 140% if the mean and
standard deviation of annual precipitation increase by 13.5%.
This estimate suggests that flood losses are related primarily to
the exposure of people to natural hazards due to the lack of social
infrastructure, since the explanatory power of the model including
population and wealth is 82%, while adding precipitation increases
this to 89%. [WGII 3.5.2]
Another study examined the potential flood damage impacts of
changes in extreme precipitation events by using the Canadian
Climate Center model and the IS92a scenario for the metro Boston
area in the north-eastern USA (Kirshen et al., 2005b). This study
found that, without adaptation investments, both the number of
properties damaged by floods and the overall cost of flood damage
would double by 2100, relative to what might be expected if
there was no climate change. It also found that flood-related
transportation delays would become an increasingly significant
nuisance over the course of this century. The study concluded that
the likely economic magnitude of these damages is sufficiently
high to justify large expenditures on adaptation strategies such as
universal flood-proofing in floodplains. [WGII 3.5.2]
These findings are also supported by a scenario study on the
damages from river and coastal flooding in England and Wales
in the 2080s, which combined four emissions scenarios with four
scenarios of socio-economic change in an SRES-like framework
(Hall et al., 2005). In all scenarios, flood damages are projected
to increase unless current flood management policies, practices
and infrastructure are changed. By the 2080s, annual damage is
projected to be £5 billion in a B1-type world, as compared with
£1 billion today, while with approximately the same climate
change, damage is only £1.5 billion in a B2-type world. Both the
B1 and B2 scenarios give approximately similar results if these
numbers are normalised with respect to gross domestic product. In
an A1-type world, the annual damage would amount to £15 billion
by the 2050s and £21 billion by the 2080s (Evans et al., 2004; Hall
et al., 2005). [WGII 3.5.2]
Increased flood periods in the future would disrupt navigation
more often, and low flow conditions that restrict the loading of
ships may increase. For example, restrictions on loading in the
Rhine River may increase from 19 days under current climate
conditions to 26–34 days in the 2050s (Middelkoop et al., 2001).
[WGII 3.5.1]
Climate-change is likely to alter river discharge, resulting in
important impacts on water availability for instream usage,
particularly hydropower generation. Hydropower impacts for
Europe have been estimated using a macro-scale hydrological
model. The results indicate that by the 2070s the electricity
production potential of hydropower plants existing at the end of
the 20th century will increase (assuming IS92a emissions) by
15–30% in Scandinavia and northern Russia, where currently
between 19% (Finland) and almost 100% (Norway) of electricity
is produced by hydropower (Lehner et al., 2005). Decreases of
20–50% and more are found for Portugal, Spain, Ukraine and
Bulgaria, where currently between 10% (Ukraine, Bulgaria)
and 39% of the electricity is produced by hydropower (Lehner
et al., 2005). For the whole of Europe (with a 20% hydropower
fraction), hydropower potential is projected to decrease by 7–12%
by the 2070s. [WGII 3.5.1]
47
Section 3 Linking climate change and water resources: impacts and responses
In North America, potential reductions in the outflow of the
Great Lakes could result in significant economic losses as a
result of reduced hydropower generation both at Niagara and
on the St. Lawrence River (Lofgren et al., 2002). For a CGCM1
model projection with 2°C global warming, Ontario’s Niagara
and St. Lawrence hydropower generation would decline by 25–
35%, resulting in annual losses of Canadian $240–350 million
at 2002 prices (Buttle et al., 2004). With the HadCM218 climate
model, however, a small gain in hydropower potential (+3%)
was found, worth approximately Canadian $25 million per
year. Another study that examined a range of climate model
scenarios found that a 2°C global warming could reduce
hydropower generating capacity on the St. Lawrence River by
1–17% (LOSLR, 2006). [WGII 3.5.1]
3.2.7 Freshwater areas and sectors highly
vulnerable to climate change
In many regions of the globe, climate change impacts on
freshwater resources may affect sustainable development and
put at risk, for example, the reduction of poverty and child
mortality. Even with optimal water management, it is very
likely that negative impacts on sustainable development cannot
be avoided. Figure 3.4 shows some key cases around the
world, where freshwater-related climate change impacts are a
threat to the sustainable development of the affected regions.
‘Sustainable’ water resources management is generally sought
to be achieved by integrated water resources management
(IWRM: see Footnote 17 for a definition). However, the precise
interpretation of this term varies considerably. All definitions
broadly include the concept of maintaining and enhancing the
environment, and particularly the water environment, taking into
account competing users, instream ecosystems and wetlands.
They also consider the wider environmental implications of
water management policies such as the implications of water
management policies on land management and, conversely,
the implications of land management policies on the water
environment. Water governance is an important component of
managing water to achieve sustainable water resources for a
range of political, socio-economic and administrative systems
(GWP, 2002; Eakin and Lemos, 2006). [WGII 3.7]
3.2.8 Uncertainties in the projected impacts of
climate change on freshwater systems
Uncertainties in climate change impacts on water resources are
mainly due to the uncertainty in precipitation inputs and less
due to the uncertainties in greenhouse gas emissions (Döll et al.,
18 See Appendix I for model descriptions.
Figure 3.4: Illustrative map of future climate change impacts related to freshwater which threaten the sustainable development
of the affected regions. 1: Bobba et al. (2000), 2: Barnett et al. (2004), 3: Döll and Flörke (2005), 4: Mirza et al. (2003), 5:

Linking climate change and water resources: impacts and responses Section 3
2003; Arnell, 2004), in climate sensitivities (Prudhomme et al.,
2003), or in hydrological models themselves (Kaspar, 2003). A
further source of uncertainty regarding the projected impacts
of climate change on freshwater systems is the nature, extent,
and relative success of those initiatives and measures already
planned as interventions. The impacts illustrated in Figure 3.4
would be realised differently depending on any adaptation
measures taken. The feedbacks from adaptation measures
to climate change are not fully considered in current future
predictions, such as the longer growing season of crops and
more regulations on river flow, with increased reservoir storage.
The comparison of different sources of uncertainty in flood
statistics in two UK catchments (Kay et al., 2006a) led to the
conclusion that the largest source of uncertainty was the GCM
structure, followed by the emissions scenarios and hydrological
modelling. Similar conclusions were made by Prudhomme and
Davies (2006) in regard to mean monthly flows and low-flow
statistics in Great Britain. [WGII 3.3.1]
Multi-model probabilistic approaches are preferable to using the
output of only one climate model, when assessing uncertainty
in the impact of climate change on water resources. Since the
TAR, several hydrological impact studies have used multi-model
climate inputs (e.g., Arnell (2004) at the global scale and Jasper
et al. (2004) at a river-basin scale), but studies incorporating
probabilistic assessments are rare. [WGII 3.3.1]
In many impacts studies, time-series of observed climate values
are adjusted by using the computed change in climate variables to
obtain scenarios that are consistent with present-day conditions.
These adjustments aim to minimise the impacts of the error
in climate modelling of the GCMs under the assumption that
the biases in climate modelling are of similar magnitude for
current and future time horizons. This is particularly important
for precipitation projections, where differences between the
observed values and those computed by climate models are
substantial. [WGII 3.3.1]
Changes in interannual or daily variability of climate variables
are often not taken into account in hydrological impact studies.
This leads to an underestimation of future floods and droughts
as well as water availability and irrigation water requirements.
[WGII 3.3.1] Selections of indicators and threshold values to
quantify the impact of climate change on freshwater resources
are also sources of uncertainty.
So as to overcome the mismatch of spatial grid scales between
GCM and hydrological processes, techniques have been
developed that downscale GCM outputs to a finer spatial
(and temporal) resolution. [WGI TAR Chapter 10] The main
assumption of these techniques is that the statistical relationships
identified for current climate will remain valid under changes in
future conditions. Downscaling techniques may allow modellers
to incorporate daily variability in future changes (e.g., Diaz-
Nieto and Wilby, 2005) and to apply a probabilistic framework
to produce information on future river flows for water resource
planning (Wilby and Harris, 2006). These approaches help
to compare different sources of uncertainty affecting water
resource projections. [WGII 3.3.1]
Efforts to quantify the economic impacts of climate-related
changes in water resources are hampered by a lack of data
and by the fact that the estimates are highly sensitive to both
the estimation methods and the different assumptions used
regarding allocation of changes in water availability across
various types of water uses, e.g., between agricultural, urban or
instream uses (Changnon, 2005; Schlenker et al., 2005; Young,
2005). [WGII 3.5]
Water managers have long dealt with changing demands for water
resources. To date, water managers have typically assumed that
the natural resource base is reasonably constant over the medium
term and, therefore, that past hydrological experience provides
a good guide to future conditions. Climate change challenges
these conventional assumptions and may alter the reliability
of water management systems. [WGII 3.6.1] Management
responses to climate change include the development of new
approaches to system assessment and design, and non-structural
methods through such mechanisms as the European Union Water
Framework Directive. [WGII 12.2.2]
Table 3.4 summarises some supply-side and demand-side
adaptation options, designed to ensure supplies during average
and drought conditions. Supply-side options generally involve
increases in storage capacity or abstraction from water courses
and therefore may have adverse environmental consequences.
Demand-side options may lack practical effectiveness because
they rely on the cumulative actions of individuals. Some options
may be inconsistent with mitigation measures because they
involve high energy consumption, e.g., desalination, pumping.
A distinction is frequently made between autonomous and
planned adaptations. Autonomous adaptations are those that
do not constitute a conscious response to climate stimuli, but
result from changes to meet altered demands, objectives and
expectations which, whilst not deliberately designed to cope
with climate change, may lessen the consequences of that
change. Such adaptations are widespread in the water sector,
although with varying degrees of effectiveness in coping with
climate change (see Table 3.5). [WGII 3.6.1] In Latin America,
some autonomous adaptation practices have been put in place,
including the use of managing trans-basin diversions and the
optimisation of water use. [WGII 13.5.1.3] In Africa, local
communities and farmers have developed adaptation schemes to
forecast rainfall using accumulated experience. Farmers in the
Sahel also use traditional water harvesting systems to supplement
irrigation practices. [WGII 9.6.2.1, 9.5.1, Table 9.2]
Planned adaptations are the result of deliberate policy decisions
and specifically take climate change and variability into account,
3.3 Water-related adaptation to climate
change: an overview
49
Section 3 Linking climate change and water resources: impacts and responses
and have so far been implemented infrequently. Water managers
in a few countries, including the Netherlands, Australia, the
UK, Germany, the USA and Bangladesh, have begun to address
directly the implications of climate change as part of their
standard flood and water supply management practices. [WGII
3.2, 3.6.5, 17.2.2] These adaptations have generally taken the
form of alterations to methods and procedures, such as design
standards and the calculation of climate change allowances.
For example, such adaptations have been implemented for
flood preparedness in the UK and the Netherlands (Klijn et
al., 2001; Richardson, 2002), for water supply in the UK
(Arnell and Delaney, 2006), and for water planning in general
in Bangladesh. [WGII 3.6.5, 17.2.2] Examples of ‘concrete’
actions in the water sector to adapt specifically and solely to a
changing climate are very rare. This is partly because climate
change may be only one of many drivers affecting strategies
and investment plans (and it may not be the most important
one over the short-term planning horizon), and partly due to
uncertainty in projections of future hydrological changes.
Adaptation to changes in water availability and quality will
have to be made, not only by water management agencies but
also by individual users of the water environment. These will
include industry, farmers (especially irrigators) and individual
consumers. Although there is much experience with adaptation
to changing demand and legislation, little is known about how
such organisations and individuals will be able to adapt to a
changing climate.
Table 3.5 outlines some of the adaptation measures, both
planned and autonomous, currently in use across the world, as
presented in the regional chapters in the WGII AR4. The table
is not exhaustive, and many individual measures can be used in
many locations.
There is high confidence that adaptation can reduce vulnerability,
especially in the short term. [WGII 17.2, 18.1, 18.5, 20.3, 20.8]
However, adaptive capacity is intimately connected to social
and economic development, but it is not evenly distributed
across and within societies. The poor, elderly, female, sick, and
indigenous populations typically have less capacity. [WGII 7.1,
7.2, 7.4, 17.3]
It is possible to define five different types of limits on adaptation
to the effects of climate change. [WGII 17.4.2]
(a) Physical or ecological: it may not be possible to prevent adverse
effects of climate change through either technical means or
institutional changes. For example, it may be impossible to
adapt where rivers dry up completely. [WGII 3.6.4]
(b) Technical, political or social: for example, it may be
difficult to find acceptable sites for new reservoirs, or for
water users to consume less. [WGII 3.6.4]
(c) Economic: an adaptation strategy may simply be too costly
in relation to the benefits achieved by its implementation.
(d) Cultural and institutional: these may include the
institutional context within which water management
operates, the low priority given to water management,
lack of co-ordination between agencies, tensions between
different scales, ineffective governance, and uncertainty
over future climate change (Ivey et al., 2004; Naess et
al., 2005; Crabbe and Robin, 2006); all act as institutional
constraints on adaptation. [WGII 3.6.4]
(e) Cognitive and informational: for example, water managers
may not recognise the challenge of climate change, or may
give it low priority compared with other challenges. A key
informational barrier is the lack of access to methodologies
to cope consistently and rigorously with climate change.
[WGII 17.4.2.4]
Climate change poses a conceptual challenge to water managers
by introducing uncertainty in future hydrological conditions.
It may also be very difficult to detect an underlying trend
(Wilby, 2006), meaning that adaptation decisions may have
to be made before it is clear how hydrological regimes may
actually be changing. Water management in the face of climate
change therefore needs to adopt a scenario-based approach
(Beuhler, 2003; Simonovic and Li, 2003). This is being used
in practice in countries such as the UK (Arnell and Delaney,
2006) and Australia (Dessai et al., 2005). However, there are
two problems. First, there are often large differences in impact
between scenarios, requiring that analyses be based on several
scenarios. Second, water managers in some countries demand
information on the likelihood of defined outcomes occurring
in order to make risk-based decisions (e.g., Jones and Page,
Supply-side Demand-side
Prospecting and extraction of groundwater Improvement of water-use efficiency by recycling water
Increasing storage capacity by building reservoirs and
dams
Reduction in water demand for irrigation by changing the cropping calendar, crop
mix, irrigation method, and area planted
Desalination of sea water Reduction in water demand for irrigation by importing agricultural products, i.e.,
virtual water
Expansion of rain-water storage Promotion of indigenous practices for sustainable water use
Removal of invasive non-native vegetation from riparian
areas
Expanded use of water markets to reallocate water to highly valued uses
Water transfer Expanded use of economic incentives including metering and pricing to encourage
water conservation

Section 3 Linking climate change and water resources: impacts and responses
2001). Techniques are therefore being developed to construct
probability distributions of specified outcomes, requiring that
assumptions be made about the probability distributions of
the key drivers of impact uncertainty (e.g., Wilby and Harris,
2006). [WGII 3.6.4]
A second approach to coping with uncertainty, referred to as
‘adaptive management’ (Stakhiv, 1998), involves the increased
use of water management measures that are relatively robust to
uncertainty. Such tools include measures to reduce the demand
for water and have been advocated as a means of minimising
the exposure of a system to climate change (e.g., in California:
Beuhler, 2003). Similarly, some resilient strategies for flood
management, e.g., allowing rivers to flood temporarily,
and reducing exposure to flood damage, are more robust to
uncertainty than traditional flood protection measures (Klijn et
al., 2004; Olsen, 2006). [WGII 3.6.4]
3.3.1 Integrated water resources management
Integrated water resources management (IWRM: see Footnote
17) should be an instrument to explore adaptation measures
to climate change, but so far it is in its infancy. Successful
integrated water management strategies include, among others:
capturing society’s views, reshaping planning processes, coordinating
land and water resources management, recognising
water quantity and quality linkages, conjunctive use of surface
water and groundwater, protecting and restoring natural
systems, and including consideration of climate change. In
addition, integrated strategies explicitly address impediments
to the flow of information. A fully integrated approach is not
always needed but, rather, the appropriate scale for integration
will depend on the extent to which it facilitates effective
action in response to specific needs (Moench et al., 2003). In
particular, an integrated approach to water management could
help to resolve conflicts between competing water users.
In several places in the western USA, water managers and
various interest groups have been experimenting with methods
to promote consensus-based decision making. These efforts
include local watershed initiatives and state-led or federallysponsored
efforts to incorporate stakeholder involvement
in planning processes (e.g., US Department of the Interior,
2005). Such initiatives can facilitate negotiations between
competing interest groups to achieve mutually satisfactory
problem solving that considers a wide range of factors. In the
case of large watersheds, such as the Colorado River Basin,
these factors cross several time- and space-scales (Table 3.6).

Section 4 Climate change and water resources in systems and sectors
4.1 Ecosystems and biodiversity
4.1.1 Context
Temperature and moisture regimes are among the key variables
that determine the distribution, growth and productivity, and
reproduction of plants and animals. Changes in hydrology can
influence species in a variety of ways, but the most completely
understood processes are those that link moisture availability
with intrinsic thresholds that govern metabolic and reproductive
processes (Burkett et al., 2005). The changes in climate that are
anticipated in the coming decades will have diverse effects on
moisture availability, ranging from alterations in the timing and
volume of streamflow to the lowering of water levels in many
wetlands, the expansion of thermokarst lakes in the Arctic, and a
decline in mist water availability in tropical mountain forests.
Observed global trends in precipitation, humidity, drought and
runoff over the last century are summarised in WGI AR4 Chapter
3. Although changes in precipitation during the last century
indicate considerable regional variation [WGI Figure 3.14],
they also reveal some important and highly significant trends.
Precipitation increased generally in the Northern Hemisphere
from 1900 to 2005, but the tendency towards more widespread
drought increased concomitantly for many large regions of the
tropics and the Southern Hemisphere, notably the African Sahel
and southern Africa, Central America, south Asia and eastern
Australia. [WGI 3.3.5]
4.1.2 Projected changes in hydrology and
implications for global biodiversity
The IPCC Fourth Assessment Report estimates of global
warming vary in range from 0.5°C in the Southern Hemisphere
to 2°C in the northern polar region by 2030 for SRES scenarios
B1, A1 and A2, with B1 showing the highest warming. While
the models simulate global mean precipitation increases, there
is substantial spatial and temporal variation. General circulation
models (GCMs) project an increase in precipitation at high
latitudes, although the amount of that increase varies between
models, and decreases in precipitation over many sub-tropical
and mid-latitude areas in both hemispheres. [WGI Figures
10.8 and 10.12] Precipitation during the coming decades is
projected to be more concentrated into more intense events,
with longer periods of little precipitation in between. [WGI
10.3.6.1] The increase in the number of consecutive dry days is
projected to be most significant in North and Central America,
the Caribbean, north-eastern and south-western South America,
southern Europe and the Mediterranean, southern Africa and
western Australia. [WGI Figure 10.18] Impacts of warming and
changes in precipitation patterns in tropical and sub-tropical
regions have important implications for global biodiversity,
because species diversity generally decreases with distance
away from the Equator.
The changes in hydrology that are projected by WGI AR4 for
the 21st century (see Section 2) will be very likely to impact
biodiversity on every continent. Impacts on species have
already been detected in most regions of the world. [WGII 1.3,
4.2] A review of 143 published studies by Root et al. (2003)
indicates that animals and plants are already showing discernible
changes consistent with the climatic trends of the 20th century.
Approximately 80% of the changes were consistent with
observed temperature change, but it should be recognised that
temperature can also exert its influence on species through
changes in moisture availability. [WGII 1.4.1]
Ecosystem responses to changes in hydrology often involve
complex interactions of biotic and abiotic processes. The
assemblages of species in ecological communities reflect the
fact that these interactions and responses are often non-linear,
which increases the difficulty of projecting specific ecological
outcomes. Since the timing of responses is not always
synchronous in species from different taxonomic groups,
there may be a decoupling of species from their food sources,
a disruption of symbiotic or facilitative relationships between
species, and changes in competition between species. Owing
to a combination of differential responses between species and
interactions that could theoretically occur at any point in a food
web, some of the ecological communities existing today could
easily be disaggregated in the future (Root and Schneider, 2002;
Burkett et al., 2005). [WGII 1.3.5.5, 4.2.2, 4.4]
Due to the combined effects of temperature and water stress,
the extinction of some amphibians and other aquatic species is
projected in Costa Rica, Spain and Australia (Pounds et al., 2006).
[WGII Table 4.1] Drying of wetlands in the Sahel will affect
the migration success of birds that use the Sahelian wetlands as
stopovers in their migration to Northern Hemisphere breeding
sites. In southern Africa, unprecedented levels of extinctions
in both plant and animal species are envisaged. [WGII Table
9.1] In montane forests, many species depend on mist as their
source of water: global warming will raise the cloud base and
affect those species dependent on this resource. [WGII 13.4.1]
Of all ecosystems, however, freshwater aquatic ecosystems
appear to have the highest proportion of species threatened
with extinction by climate change (Millennium Ecosystem
Assessment, 2005b). [WGII 3.5.1]
4.1.3 Impacts of changes in hydrology on major
ecosystem types
4.1.3.1 Lakes and streams
Impacts of global warming on lakes include an extended
growing period at high latitudes, intensified stratification and
nutrient loss from surface waters, decreased hypolimnetic
oxygen (below the thermocline) in deep, stratified lakes, and
expansion in range for many invasive aquatic weeds. Water
levels are expected to increase in lakes at high latitudes,
where climate models indicate increased precipitation, while
water levels at mid- and low latitudes are projected to decline.
Endorheic (terminal or closed) lakes are most vulnerable to
a change in climate because of their sensitivity to changes in
the balance of inflows and evaporation. Changes in inflows to
such lakes can have very substantial effects and, under some
56
Climate change and water resources in systems and sectors Section 4
climatic conditions, they may disappear entirely. The Aral
Sea, for example, has been significantly reduced by increased
abstractions of irrigation water upstream; and Qinghai Lake in
China has shrunk following a fall in catchment precipitation.
[WGII TAR 4.3.7]
The duration of ice cover in lakes and rivers at mid- to high
latitudes has decreased by approximately two weeks during the
past century in the Northern Hemisphere. [WGI TAR SPM]
Increases in summer water temperature can increase anoxia
in stratified lakes, increase the rate of phosphorus releases
from lake-bottom sediments, and cause algal blooms that
restructure the aquatic food web. [WGII 4.4.8] A unit increase
in temperature in tropical lakes causes a proportionately higher
density differential as compared with colder temperate lakes.
Thus, projected tropical temperatures [WGI Chapters 10 and
11] will lead to strong thermal stratification, causing anoxia
in deep layers of lakes and nutrient depletion in shallow lake
waters. Reduced oxygen concentrations will generally reduce
aquatic species diversity, especially in cases where water quality
is impaired by eutrophication. [CCB 4.4]
Reduced oxygen concentrations tend to alter biotic assemblages,
biogeochemistry and the overall productivity of lakes and
streams. The thermal optima for many mid- to high-latitude
cold-water taxa are lower than 20°C. Species extinctions are
expected when warm summer temperatures and anoxia eliminate
deep cold-water refugia. In the southern Great Plains of the
USA, water temperatures are already approaching lethal limits
for many native stream fish. Organic matter decomposition
rates increase with temperature, thereby shortening the period
over which detritus is available to aquatic invertebrates. [CCB
6.2] Invasive alien species represent a major threat to native
biodiversity in aquatic ecosystems. [WGII 4.2.2] The rise in
global temperature will tend to extend polewards the ranges of
many invasive aquatic plants, such as Eichhornia and Salvinia.
[RICC 2.3.6]
Effects of warming on riverine systems may be strongest in
humid regions, where flows are less variable and biological
interactions control the abundance of organisms. Drying of
stream-beds and lakes for extended periods could reduce
ecosystem productivity because of the restriction on aquatic
habitat, combined with lowered water quality via increased
oxygen deficits and pollutant concentrations. In semi-arid
parts of the world, reductions in seasonal streamflow and
complete drying up of lakes (such as in the Sahel of Africa)
can have profound effects on ecosystem services, including the
maintenance of biodiversity. [CCB 6.7]
Currently, species richness is highest in freshwater systems
in central Europe and decreases to the north and south due
to periodic droughts and salinisation (Declerck et al. 2005).
Ensemble GCM runs for the IPCC AR4 indicate a south–north
contrast in precipitation, with increases in the north and decreases
in the south. [WGI 11.3.3.2] An increase in projected runoff and
lower risk of drought could benefit the fauna of aquatic systems
in northern Europe, while decreased water availability in the
south could have the opposite effect (Álvarez Cobelas et al.,
2005). [WGII 12.4.6]
4.1.3.2 Freshwater wetlands
The high degree of variability in the structure of wetland systems
is due mainly to their individual hydrology, varying from
peatland bogs in high-latitude boreal forests, through tropical
monsoonal wetlands (e.g., the Kakadu wetlands, Australia), to
high-altitude wetlands in the Tibetan and Andean mountains.
Climate change will have its most pronounced effects on
inland freshwater wetlands through altered precipitation and
more frequent or intense disturbance events (droughts, storms,
floods). Relatively small increases in precipitation variability
can significantly affect wetland plants and animals at different
stages of their life cycle (Keddy, 2000). [WGII 4.4.8] Generally,
climatic warming is expected to start a drying trend in wetland
ecosystems. This largely indirect influence of climate change,
leading to alterations in the water level, would be the main
agent in wetland ecosystem change and would overshadow the
impacts of rising temperature and longer growing seasons in
boreal and sub-Arctic peatlands (Gorham, 1991). Monsoonal
areas are more likely to be affected by more intense rain events
over shorter rainy seasons, exacerbating flooding and erosion in
catchments and the wetlands themselves. [WGII TAR 5.8.3]
Most wetland processes are dependent on catchment-level
hydrology, which can be altered by changes in land use as well
as surface water resource management practices. [WGII TAR
5.ES] Recharge of local and regional groundwater systems, the
position of the wetland relative to the local topography, and the
gradient of larger regional groundwater systems are also critical
factors in determining the variability and stability of moisture
storage in wetlands in climatic zones where precipitation does not
greatly exceed evaporation (Winter and Woo, 1990). Changes in
recharge external to the wetland may be as important to the fate
of the wetland under changing climatic conditions, as are the
changes in direct precipitation and evaporation on the wetland
itself (Woo et al., 1993). [WGII TAR 5.8.2.1] Thus, it may be
very difficult, if not impossible, to adapt to the consequences
of projected changes in water availability. [WGII TAR 5.8.4]
Due, in part, to their limited capacity for adaptation, wetlands
are considered to be among the ecosystems most vulnerable to
climate change. [WGII 4.4.8]
Wetlands are often biodiversity hotspots. Many have world
conservation status (Ramsar sites, World Heritage sites). Their
loss could lead to significant extinctions, especially among
amphibians and aquatic reptiles. [WGII 4.4.8] The TAR
identified Arctic and sub-Arctic ombrotrophic (‘cloud-fed’)
bogs and depressional wetlands with small catchments as the
most vulnerable aquatic systems to climate change. [WGII TAR
5.8.5] The more recent AR4, however, suggests a very high
degree of vulnerability for many additional wetland types, such
as monsoonal wetlands in India and Australia, boreal peatlands,
North America’s prairie pothole wetlands and African Great
Lake wetlands. [WGII 4.4.8, 4.4.10] The seasonal migration
patterns and routes of many wetland species will have to change;
57
Section 4 Climate change and water resources in systems and sectors
otherwise some species will be threatened with extinction.
[WGII 4.4.8] For key habitats, small-scale restoration may be
possible, if sufficient water is available. [WGII TAR 5.8.4]
Due to changes in hydrology associated with atmospheric
warming, the area of wetland habitat has increased in some
regions. In the Arctic region, thawing of permafrost is giving
rise to new wetlands. [WGII 1.3] Thermokarst features, which
result from the melting of ground ice in a region underlain
by permafrost, can displace Arctic biota through either oversaturation
or drying (Hinzman et al., 2005; Walsh et al., 2005).
Extensive thermokarst development has been discovered in
North America near Council, Alaska (Yoshikawa and Hinzman,
2003) and in central Yakutia (Gavriliev and Efremov, 2003).
[WGI 4.7.2.3] Initially, permafrost thaw forms depressions
for new wetlands and ponds that are interconnected by new
drainage features. As the permafrost thaws further, surface
waters drain into groundwater systems, leading to losses in
freshwater habitat. [WGII 15.4.1.3] Warming may have already
caused the loss of wetland area as lakes on the Yukon Delta
expanded during the past century (Coleman and Huh, 2004).
[WGII 15.6.2]
Small increases in the variability in precipitation regimes can
significantly affect wetland plants and animals (Keddy, 2000;
Burkett and Kusler, 2000). Biodiversity in seasonal wetlands,
such as vernal pools, can be strongly impacted by changes in
precipitation and soil moisture (Bauder, 2005). In monsoonal
regions, prolonged dry periods promote terrestrialisation of
wetlands, as witnessed in Keoladeo National Park (Chauhan
and Gopal, 2001). [WGII 4.4.8]
4.1.3.3 Coasts and estuaries
Changes in the timing and volume of freshwater runoff will
affect salinity, sediment and nutrient availability, and moisture
regimes in coastal ecosystems. Climate change can affect
each of these variables by altering precipitation and locally
driven runoff or, more importantly, runoff from watersheds
that drain into the coastal zone. [WGII 6.4.1.3] Hydrology
has a strong influence on the distribution of coastal wetland
plant communities, which typically grade inland from salt, to
brackish, to freshwater species. [WGII 6.4.1.4]
The effects of sea-level rise on coastal landforms vary
among coastal regions because the rate of sea-level rise is
not spatially uniform [WGI 5.5.2] and because some coastal
regions experience uplift or subsidence due to processes that
are independent of climate change. Such processes include
groundwater withdrawals, oil and gas extraction, and isostacy
(adjustment of the Earth’s surface on geological timescales
to changes in surface mass; e.g., due to changes in ice sheet
mass following the last deglaciation). In addition to changes in
elevation along the coast, factors arising inland can influence
the net effect of sea-level rise on coastal ecosystems. The
natural ecosystems within watersheds have been fragmented
and the downstream flow of water, sediment and nutrients to
the coast has been disrupted (Nilsson et al., 2005). Land-use
change and hydrological modifications have had downstream
impacts, in addition to localised influences, including human
development on the coast. Erosion has increased the sediment
load reaching the coast; for example, suspended loads in the
Huanghe (Yellow) River have increased 2–10 times over the
past 2,000 years (Jiongxin, 2003). In contrast, damming and
channelisation have greatly reduced the supply of sediments
to the coast on other rivers through the retention of sediment
in dams (Syvistki et al., 2005), and this effect will probably
dominate during the 21st century. [WGII 6.4]
Climate model ensemble runs by Milly et al. (2005) indicate
that climate change during the next 50–100 years will increase
discharges to coastal waters in the Arctic, in northern Argentina
and southern Brazil, parts of the Indian sub-continent and
China, while reduced discharges to coastal waters are suggested
in southern Argentina and Chile, western Australia, western and
southern Africa, and in the Mediterranean Basin. [WGII 6.3.2;
see Figure 2.10 in this volume] If river discharge decreases, the
salinity of coastal estuaries and wetlands is expected to increase
and the amount of sediments and nutrients delivered to the
coast to decrease. In coastal areas where streamflow decreases,
salinity will tend to advance upstream, thereby altering the
zonation of plant and animal species as well as the availability
of freshwater for human use. The increased salinity of coastal
waters since 1950 has contributed to the decline of cabbage
palm forests in Florida (Williams et al., 1999) and bald cypress
forests in Louisiana (Krauss et al., 2000). Increasing salinity
has also played a role in the expansion of mangroves into
adjacent marshes in the Florida Everglades (Ross et al., 2000)
and throughout south-eastern Australia during the past 50 years
(Saintilan and Williams, 1999). [WGII 6.4.1.4] Saltwater
intrusion as a result of a combination of sea-level rise, decreases
in river flows and increased drought frequency are expected to
alter estuarine-dependent coastal fisheries during this century in
parts of Africa, Australia and Asia. [WGII 6.4.1.3, 9.4.4, 10.4.1,
11.4.2]
Deltaic coasts are particularly vulnerable to changes in runoff
and sediment transport, which affect the ability of a delta to
cope with the physical impacts of climatic change. In Asia,
where human activities have led to increased sediment loads
of major rivers in the past, the construction of upstream dams
is now depleting the supply of sediments to many deltas, with
increased coastal erosion becoming a widespread consequence
(Li et al., 2004; Syvitski et al., 2005; Ericson et al., 2006).
[WGII 6.2.3, 6.4.1] In the subsiding Mississippi River deltaic
plain of south-east Louisiana, sediment starvation due to human
intervention in deltaic processes and concurrent increases in the
salinity and water levels of coastal marshes occurred so rapidly
that 1,565 km2 of intertidal coastal marshes and adjacent coastal
lowlands were converted to open water between 1978 and 2000
(Barras et al., 2003). [WGII 6.4.1]
Some of the greatest potential impacts of climate change
on estuaries may result from changes in physical mixing
characteristics caused by changes in freshwater runoff (Scavia
58
Climate change and water resources in systems and sectors Section 4
et al., 2002). Freshwater inflows into estuaries influence water
residence time, nutrient delivery, vertical stratification, salinity,
and control of phytoplankton growth rates (Moore et al.,
1997). Changes in river discharges into shallow near-shore
marine environments will lead to changes in turbidity, salinity,
stratification and nutrient availability (Justic et al., 2005).
[WGII 6.4.1.3]
4.1.3.4 Mountain ecosystems
The zonation of ecosystems along mountain gradients is
mediated by temperature and soil moisture. Recent studies
(Williams et al., 2003; Pounds and Puschendorf, 2004;
Andreone et al., 2005; Pounds et al., 2006) have shown the
disproportionate risk of extinctions in mountain ecosystems
and, in particular, among endemic species. [WGII 4.4.7] Many
species of amphibians, small mammals, fish, birds and plants
are highly vulnerable to the ongoing and projected changes
in climate that alter their highly specialised mountain niche.
[WGII 1.3.5.2, 4.4.7, 9.4.5]
In many snowmelt-dominated watersheds, temperature
increase has shifted the magnitude and timing of hydrological
events. A trend towards earlier peak spring streamflow and
increased winter base flows has been observed in North
America and Eurasia. [WGII 1.3.2] A greater fraction of
annual precipitation is falling as rain rather than snow at
74% of the weather stations studied in the western mountains
of the USA between 1949 and 2004 (Knowles et al., 2006).
Since the 1970s, winter snow depth and spring snow cover
have decreased in Canada, particularly in the west, where air
temperatures have consistently increased (Brown and Braaten,
1998). Spring and summer snow cover is decreasing in the
western USA (Groisman et al., 2004). The April 1st snow water
equivalent (SWE) has decreased by 15–30% since 1950 in the
western mountains of North America, particularly at lower
elevations in spring, primarily due to warming rather than to
changes in precipitation (Mote et al., 2005). Streamflow peaks
in the snowmelt-dominated western mountains of the USA
occurred 1–4 weeks earlier in 2002 than in 1948 (Stewart et
al., 2005). [WGII 14.2.1]
The duration and depth of snow cover, often correlated with
mean temperature and precipitation (Keller et al., 2005;
Monson et al., 2006), is a key factor in many alpine ecosystems
(Körner, 1999). Missing snow cover exposes plants and animals
to frost, and influences water supply in spring (Keller et al.,
2005). If animal movements are disrupted by changing snow
patterns, as has been found in Colorado (Inouye et al., 2000),
increased wildlife mortality may result through a mismatch
between wildlife and environment. [WGII 4.4.7] For each 1°C
of temperature increase, the duration of snow cover is expected
to decline by several weeks at mid-elevations in the European
Alps. It is virtually certain that European mountain flora will
undergo major changes in response to climate change, with
changes in snow-cover duration being a more important driver
than the direct effects of temperature on animal metabolism.
[WGII 12.4.3]
Changing runoff from glacier melt has significant effects
on ecosystem services. Biota of small-watershed streams
sustained by glacial melt are highly vulnerable to extirpation.
[WGII 1.3.1, 3.2, 3.4.3]
4.1.3.5 Forests, savannas and grasslands
The availability of water is a key factor in the restructuring of
forest and grassland systems as the climate warms. Climate
change is known to alter the likelihood of increased wildfire
size and frequency, while also inducing stress in trees, which
indirectly exacerbates the effects of these disturbances. Many
forest ecosystems in the tropics, high latitudes and high
altitudes are becoming increasingly susceptible to drought and
associated changes in fire, pests and diseases. [WGII Chapter
4, 5.1.2, 13.4] It has been estimated that up to 40% of the
Amazonian forests could be affected by even slight decreases
in precipitation (Rowell and Moore, 2000). Multi-model GCM
simulations of precipitation changes over South America
during the next 100 years show a substantial (20% or more)
decrease in June, July and August precipitation in the Amazon
Basin, but a slight increase (approximately 5%) in December,
January and February. [WGI 11.6.3.2] These projected changes
in precipitation, coupled with increased temperature, portend a
replacement of some Amazonian forests by ecosystems that have
more resistance to the multiple stresses caused by temperature
increase, droughts and fires. [WGII 13.4.2]
Increases in drought conditions in several regions (Europe,
parts of Latin America) during the growing season are
projected to accompany increasing summer temperatures and
precipitation declines, with widespread effects on forest net
ecosystem productivity. Effects of drought on forests include
mortality due to disease, drought stress and pests; a reduction
in resilience; and biotic feedbacks that vary from site to site.
[WGII 4.4.5] In some regions, forests are projected to replace
other vegetation types, such as tundra and grasslands, and the
availability of water can be just as important as temperature and
CO2-enrichment effects on photosynthesis. [WGII 4.4.3, 4.4.5]
Numerous studies have evaluated the direct CO2 fertilisation
impact and warming effects on dominant forest and grassland
types. Studies involving a wide range of woody and herbaceous
species suggest that enhancements in photosynthesis due
to projected CO2 enrichment will be dependent upon water
availability. [WGII 4.4.3] Higher-order effects of CO2
enrichment in forests and savannas can have important
feedbacks on water resources. For example, atmospheric CO2
enrichment can have adverse effects on the nutritional value of
litter in streams (Tuchman et al., 2003), and soil water balance
can be strongly influenced by elevated CO2 in most grassland
types. [WGII 4.4.10] Grassland and savanna productivity is
highly sensitive to precipitation variability. In assessments of
tall-grass prairie productivity, for example, increased rainfall
variability was more significant than rainfall amount, with a
50% increase in dry-spell duration causing a 10% reduction in
net primary productivity (Fay et al., 2003a). [WGII 4.4.3]
59
Section 4 Climate change and water resources in systems and sectors
4.2.1 Context
The productivity of agricultural, forestry and fisheries systems
depends critically on the temporal and spatial distribution of
precipitation and evaporation, as well as, especially for crops,
on the availability of freshwater resources for irrigation. [WGII
5.2.1] Production systems in marginal areas with respect to water
face increased climatic vulnerability and risk under climate
change, due to factors that include, for instance, degradation
of land resources through soil erosion, over-extraction of
groundwater and associated salinisation, and over-grazing of
dryland (FAO, 2003). [WGII 5.2.2] Smallholder agriculture in
such marginal areas is especially vulnerable to climate change
and variability, and socio-economic stressors often compound
already difficult environmental conditions. [WGII 5.2.2, Table
5.2, Box 5.3] In forests, fires and insect outbreaks linked to the
frequency of extreme events have been shown to increase climate
vulnerability. In fisheries, water pollution and changes in water
resources also increase vulnerability and risk. [WGII 5.2.2]
4.2.1.1 Agriculture and food security
Water plays a crucial role in food production regionally
and worldwide. On the one hand, more than 80% of global
agricultural land is rain-fed; in these regions, crop productivity
depends solely on sufficient precipitation to meet evaporative
demand and associated soil moisture distribution (FAO, 2003).
[WGII 5.4.1.2] Where these variables are limited by climate,
such as in arid and semi-arid regions in the tropics and subtropics,
as well as in Mediterranean-type regions in Europe,
Australia and South America, agricultural production is very
vulnerable to climate change (FAO, 2003). On the other hand,
global food production depends on water not only in the form
of precipitation but also, and critically so, in the form of
available water resources for irrigation. Indeed, irrigated land,
representing a mere 18% of global agricultural land, produces
1 billion tonnes of grain annually, or about half the world’s total
supply; this is because irrigated crops yield on average 2–3
times more than their rain-fed counterparts19 (FAO, 2003).
While too little water leads to vulnerability of production,
too much water can also have deleterious effects on crop
productivity, either directly, e.g., by affecting soil properties
and by damaging plant growth, or indirectly, e.g., by harming or
delaying necessary farm operations. Heavy precipitation events,
excessive soil moisture and flooding disrupt food production
and rural livelihoods worldwide (Rosenzweig et al., 2002).
[WGII 5.4.2.1]
By critically affecting crop productivity and food production,
in addition to being a necessity in food preparation processes,
water plays a critical role in food security. Currently, 850 million

in Sections 5.1.3 (on Africa) and 5.2.3 (on Asia).
people in the world are still undernourished (FAO, 2003). [WGII
5.3.2.1, 5.6.5] Socio-economic pressures over the next several
decades will lead to increased competition between irrigation
needs and demand from non-agricultural sectors, potentially
reducing the availability and quality of water resources for
food. [WGII 3.3.2] Recent studies indicate that it is unlikely
that the Millennium Development Goal (MDG) for hunger will
be met by 2015. [WGII 5.6.5] At the same time, during this
century, climate change may further reduce water availability
for global food production, as a result of projected mean changes
in temperature and precipitation regimes, as well as due to
projected increases in the frequency of extreme events, such as
droughts and flooding (Rosenzweig et al., 2002). [WGII 5.6.5]
Climate impacts assessments of food production are, in general,
critically dependent upon the specifics of the GCM precipitation
projections used. [WGII 5.4.1.2] A wide range of precipitation
scenarios is currently available. In general, assessments using
scenarios of reduced regional precipitation typically result in
negative crop production signals, and vice versa. Projections of
increased aridity in several Mediterranean-type environments
(Europe, Australia and South America), as well as in marginal
arid and semi-arid tropical regions, especially sub-Saharan
Africa, appear to be robust across models (see Figure 2.10).
These regions face increased vulnerability under climate
change, as shown in Figure 4.1. [WGII 5.3.1]
4.2.1.2 Land use and forest ecosystems
Forest ecosystems occupy roughly 4 billion ha of land, an area
comparable to that used by crops and pastures combined. Of this
land, only about 200 million ha are used for commercial forestry
production globally (FAO, 2003). [WGII 4.4.5, 5.1.1, 5.4.5]
Forests are key determinants of water supply, quality and
quantity, in both developing and developed countries. The
importance of forests as watersheds may increase substantially
in the next few decades, as freshwater resources become
increasingly scarce, particularly in developing countries
(Mountain Agenda, 1997; Liniger and Weingartner, 1998).
[LULUCF 2.5.1.1.4; WGII 4.1.1]
Forests contribute to the regional water cycle, with large
potential effects of land-use changes on local and regional
climates (Harding, 1992; Lean et al., 1996). On the other hand,
forest protection can have drought and flood mitigation benefits,
especially in the tropics (Kramer et al., 1997; Pattanayak and
Kramer, 2000). [LULUCF 2.5.1.1.6]
Afforestation and reforestation may increase humidity, lower
temperature and increase rainfall in the regions affected
(Harding, 1992; Blythe et al., 1994); deforestation can instead
lead to decreased local rainfall and increased temperature. In
Amazonia and Asia, deforestation may lead to new climate
conditions unsuitable for successful regeneration of rainforest
species (Chan, 1986; Gash and Shuttleworth, 1991; Meher-
Homji, 1992). [LULUCF 2.5.1.1.6]
60
Climate change and water resources in systems and sectors Section 4
Forest ecosystems are differentially sensitive to climatic change
(e.g., Kirschbaum and Fischlin, 1996; Sala et al., 2000; Gitay et
al., 2001), with temperature-limited biomes being sensitive to
impacts of warming, and water-limited biomes being sensitive
to increasing levels of drought. Some, such as fire-dependent
ecosystems, may change rapidly in response to climate and
other environmental changes (Scheffer et al., 2001; Sankaran et
al., 2005). [WGII 4.1, 4.4.5]
Forest ecosystems, and the biodiversity associated with them,
may be particularly at risk in Africa, due to a combination of
socio-economic pressures, and land-use and climate-change
factors. [WGII 4.2] By 2100, negative impacts across about
25% of Africa (especially southern and western Africa) may
cause a decline in both water quality and ecosystem goods
and services. [WGII 4.ES, 4.4.8] Indeed, changes in a variety
of ecosystems are already being detected and documented,
particularly in southern Africa. [WGII 9.2.1.4]
4.2.2 Observations
4.2.2.1 Climate impacts and water
Although agriculture and forestry are known to be highly
dependent on climate, evidence of observed changes related to
regional climate changes, and specifically to water, is difficult
to find. Agriculture and forestry are also strongly influenced
by non-climate factors, especially management practices and
technological changes (Easterling, 2003) on local and regional
scales, as well as market prices and policies related to subsidies.
[WGII 1.3.6]
Although responses to recent climate change are difficult to
identify in human systems, due to multiple non-climate driving
forces and the existence of adaptation, effects have been
detected in forestry and a few agricultural systems. Changes in
several aspects of the human health system have been related
to recent warming. Adaptation to recent warming is beginning
to be systematically documented. In comparison with other
factors, recent warming has been of limited consequence in
agriculture and forestry. A significant advance in phenology,
however, has been observed for agriculture and forestry in
large parts of the Northern Hemisphere, with limited responses
in crop management. The lengthening of the growing season
has contributed to an observed increase in forest productivity
in many regions, while warmer and drier conditions are partly
responsible for reduced forest productivity and increased forest
fires in North America and the Mediterranean Basin. Both
agriculture and forestry have shown vulnerability to recent trends
in heatwaves, droughts and floods. [WGII 1.3.6, 1.3.9, 5.2]
4.2.2.2 Atmospheric CO2 and water dynamics
The effects of elevated atmospheric CO2 on plant function may
have important implications for water resources, since leaflevel
water-use efficiency increases due to increased stomatal
resistance as compared to current concentrations. For C3
plant species (including most food crops), the CO2 effect may
be relatively greater for crops that are under moisture stress,
compared to well-irrigated crops. [WGII TAR 5.3.3.1]
However, the large-scale implications of CO2–water
interactions (i.e., at canopy, field and regional level) are highly
uncertain. In general, it is recognised that the positive effects of
elevated CO2 on plant water relations are expected to be offset
by increased evaporative demand under warmer temperatures.
[WGII TAR 5.3.3.1]
Many recent studies confirm and extend TAR findings that
temperature and precipitation changes in future decades will
modify, and often limit, direct CO2 effects on plants. For
instance, high temperatures during flowering may lower CO2
effects by reducing grain number, size and quality (Thomas et
al., 2003; Baker et al., 2004; Caldwell et al., 2005). Likewise,
increased water demand under warming may reduce the expected
positive CO2 effects. Rain-fed wheat grown at 450 ppm CO2
shows grain yield increases up to 0.8°C warming, but yields then
decline beyond 1.5°C warming; additional irrigation is needed
to counterbalance these negative effects. [WGII 5.4.1.2]
Finally, plant physiologists and crop modellers alike recognise
that the effects of elevated CO2, measured in experimental
settings and implemented in models, may overestimate actual
field and farm-level responses. This is due to many limiting
factors that typically operate at the field level, such as pests,
weeds, competition for resources, soil water and air quality.
These critical factors are poorly investigated in large-scale
experimental settings, and are thus not well integrated into the
leading plant growth models. Understanding the key dynamics
characterising the interactions of elevated CO2 with climate,
soil and water quality, pests, weeds and diseases, climate
variability and ecosystem vulnerability remains a priority for
understanding the future impacts of climate change on managed
systems. [WGII 5.4.1, 5.8.2]
4.2.3 Projections
Changes in water demand and availability under climate change
will significantly affect agricultural activities and food security,
forestry and fisheries in the 21st century. On the one hand,
changes in evaporation:precipitation ratios will modify plant
water demand with respect to a baseline with no climate change.
On the other hand, modified patterns of precipitation and storage
cycles at the watershed scale will change the seasonal, annual
and interannual availability of water for terrestrial and aquatic
agro-ecosystems (FAO, 2003). Climate changes increase
irrigation demand in the majority of world regions due to a
combination of decreased rainfall and increased evaporation
arising from increased temperatures. [WGII 5.8.1]
It is expected that projected changes in the frequency and
severity of extreme climate events, such as increased frequency
of heat stress, droughts and flooding, will have significant
consequences on food, forestry (and the risk of forest fires) and
other agro-ecosystem production, over and above the impacts
of changes in mean variables alone. [WGII 5.ES] In particular,
more than 90% of simulations predict increased droughts in the
sub-tropics by the end of the 21st century [WGI SPM], while
increased extremes in precipitation are projected in the major
61
Section 4 Climate change and water resources in systems and sectors
agricultural production areas of southern and eastern Asia,
eastern Australia and northern Europe. [WGI 11.3, 11.4, 11.7]
It should be noted that climate change impact models for food,
forest products and fibre do not yet include these recent findings
on the projected patterns of precipitation change; negative
impacts are projected to be worse than currently computed,
once the effects of extremes on productivity are included.
[WGII 5.4.1, 5.4.2]
Percentage changes in annual mean runoff are indicative of
the mean water availability for vegetation cover. Projected
changes between now and 2100 [WGII Chapter 3] show some
consistent patterns: increases in high latitudes and the wet
tropics, and decreases in mid-latitudes and some parts of the
dry tropics (Figure 4.1b). Declines in water availability are
indicative of increased water stress, indicating, in particular,
a worsening in regions where water for production is already
a scarce commodity (e.g., in the Mediterranean Basin, Central
America and sub-tropical regions of Africa and Australia, see
Figure 4.1b). [WGII 5.3.1]
Finally, it may be important to recognise that production
systems and water resources will be critically shaped in the
coming decades by the concurrent interactions of socioeconomic
and climate drivers. For instance, increased demand
for irrigation water in agriculture will depend both on changed
climatic conditions and on increased demand for food by a
growing population; in addition, water availability for forest
productivity will depend on both climatic drivers and critical
anthropogenic impacts, particularly deforestation in tropical
zones. In the Amazon Basin, for instance, a combination of
deforestation and increased fragmentation may trigger severe
droughts over and above the climate signal, leading to increased
fire danger. [WGII 5.3.2.2]

(1980–1999) and 2090–2099. [Based on SYR Figure 3.5]
4.2.3.1 Crops
In general, while moderate warming in high-latitude regions
would benefit crop and pasture yields, even slight warming in
low-latitude areas, or areas that are seasonally dry, would have
a detrimental effect on yields. Modelling results for a range of
sites show that, in high-latitude regions, moderate to medium
increases in local temperature (1–3°C), along with associated
CO2 increases and rainfall changes, can have small, beneficial
impacts on crop yields. However, in low-latitude regions, even
moderate temperature increases (1–2°C) are likely to have
negative yield impacts for major cereals. Further warming has
increasingly negative impacts in all regions. [WGII 5.ES]
Regions where agriculture is currently a marginal enterprise,
largely due to a combination of poor soils, water scarcity and
rural poverty, may suffer increasingly as a result of climate
change impacts on water. As a result, even small changes in
climate will increase the number of people at risk of hunger,
with the impact being particularly great in sub-Saharan Africa.
[WGII 5.ES]
Increases in the frequency of climate extremes may lower crop
yields beyond the impacts of mean climate change. Simulation
studies since the TAR have considered specific aspects of
increased climate variability within climate change scenarios.
Rosenzweig et al. (2002) computed that, under scenarios of
increased heavy precipitation, production losses due to excessive
soil moisture (already significant today) would double in the
USA to US$3 billion/yr in 2030. In Bangladesh, the risk of crop
losses is projected to increase due to higher flood frequency
under climate change. Finally, climate change impact studies
that incorporate higher rainfall intensity indicate an increased
risk of soil erosion; in arid and semi-arid regions, high rainfall
intensity may be associated with a higher possibility of
62
Climate change and water resources in systems and sectors Section 4
salinisation, due to increased loss of water past the crop root
zone. [WGII 5.4.2.1]
Impacts of climate change on irrigation water requirements
may be large. A few new studies have further quantified the
impacts of climate change on regional and global irrigation
requirements, irrespective of the positive effects of elevated
CO2 on crop water-use efficiency. Döll (2002), in considering
the direct impacts of climate change on crop evaporative
demand, but without any CO2 effects, estimated an increase in
net crop irrigation requirements (i.e., net of transpiration losses)
of between 5% and 8% globally by 2070, with larger regional
signals (e.g., +15%) in south-east Asia. [WGII 5.4.2.1]
Fischer et al. (2006), in a study that included positive CO2 effects
on crop water-use efficiency, computed increases in global net
irrigation requirements of 20% by 2080, with larger impacts
in developed versus developing regions, due to both increased
evaporative demands and longer growing seasons under
climate change. Fischer et al. (2006) and Arnell et al. (2004)
also projected increases in water stress (measured as the ratio
of irrigation withdrawals to renewable water resources) in the
Middle East and south-east Asia. Recent regional studies have
likewise underlined critical climate change/water dynamics in
key irrigated areas, such as northern Africa (increased irrigation
requirements; Abou-Hadid et al., 2003) and China (decreased
requirements; Tao et al., 2003a). [WGII 5.4.2.1]
At the national scale, some integrative studies exist. In the
USA, two modelling studies on adaptation of the agricultural
sector to climate change (i.e., shifts between irrigated and rainfed
production) foresee a decrease in both irrigated areas and
withdrawals beyond 2030 under various climate scenarios
(Reilly et al., 2003; Thomson et al., 2005a). This is related to a
declining yield gap between irrigated and rain-fed agriculture
caused either by yield reductions of irrigated crops due to
higher temperatures, or by yield increases of rain-fed crops due
to higher precipitation. These studies did not take into account
the increasing variability of daily precipitation and, as such,
rain-fed yields are probably overestimated. [WGII 3.5.1]
For developing countries, a 14% increase in irrigation water
withdrawal by 2030 was foreseen in an FAO study that did
not consider the impacts of climate change (Bruinsma, 2003).
However, the four Millennium Ecosystem Assessment scenarios
project much smaller increases in irrigation withdrawal at the
global scale, as they assume that the area under irrigation will
only increase by between 0% and 6% by 2030; and between 0%
and 10% by 2050. [WGII 3.5.1]
The overwhelming water use increases are likely to occur in the
domestic and industrial sectors, with withdrawals increasing
by between 14% and 83% by 2050 (Millennium Ecosystem
Assessment, 2005a, b). This is based on the idea that the value
of water will be much higher for domestic and industrial uses,
which is particularly true under conditions of water stress.
[WGII 3.5.1]
Locally, irrigated agriculture may face new problems linked to
the spatial and temporal distribution of streamflow. For instance,
at low latitudes, especially in south-east Asia, early snowmelt
may cause spring flooding and lead to a summer irrigation water
shortage. [WGII 5.8.2]
4.2.3.2 Pastures and livestock
Many of the world’s rangelands are in semi-arid areas and
susceptible to water deficits; any further decline in water
resources will greatly impact carrying capacity. As a result,
increased climate variability and droughts may lead to livestock
loss. Specifically, the impact on animal productivity due to
increased variability in weather patterns is likely to be far
greater than effects associated with changes in average climatic
conditions. The most frequent catastrophic losses arising
from a lack of prior conditioning to weather events occur in
confined cattle feedlots, with economic losses from reduced
cattle performance exceeding those associated with cattle death
losses by several-fold. [WGII 5.4.3.1]
Many of the world’s rangelands are affected by El Niño–
Southern Oscillation (ENSO) events. Under ENSO-related
drought events, in dry regions there are risks of positive
feedback between the degradation of both soils and vegetation
and reductions in rainfall, with consequences in terms of loss
of both pastoral and farming lands. [WGII 5.4.3.1] However,
while WGI TAR indicated an increased likelihood of ENSO
frequency under climate change, the WGI AR4 did not find
correlations between ENSO and climate change. [WGI TAR
SPM; WGI 10.3.5.4]
A survey of experimental data worldwide suggested that mild
warming generally increases grassland productivity, with the
strongest positive responses at high latitudes, and that the
productivity and composition of plant species in rangelands are
highly correlated with precipitation. In addition, recent findings
(see Figure 4.1) projected declines in rainfall in some major
grassland and rangeland areas (e.g., South America, southern
and northern Africa, western Asia, Australia and southern
Europe). [WGII 5.4.3.2]
Elevated atmospheric CO2 can reduce soil water depletion in
different native and semi-native temperate and Mediterranean
grassland. However, in conjunction with climate change,
increased variability in rainfall and warmer temperatures may
create more severe soil moisture limitations, and hence reduced
productivity, offsetting the beneficial effects of CO2. Other
impacts on livestock occur directly through the increase in
thermal heat load. [WGII 5.4.3.2]
4.2.3.3 Fisheries
Negative impacts of climate change on aquaculture and
freshwater fisheries include: stress due to increased temperature
and oxygen demand and decreased pH; uncertain future
water quality and volume; extreme weather events; increased
frequency of disease and toxic events; sea-level rise and
conflicts of interest with coastal defence needs; and uncertain

Section 4 Climate change and water resources in systems and sectors
future supplies of fishmeal and oils from capture fisheries. A
case study of the multiple stresses that may affect fisheries in
developing countries is included in Box 4.1. [WGII 5.4.6.1]
Positive impacts include increased growth rates and food
conversion efficiencies; increased length of growing season;
range expansion; and the use of new areas due to decreased ice
cover. [WGII 5.4.6.1]
4.2.4 Adaptation, vulnerability and sustainable
development
Water management is a critical component that needs to adapt
in the face of both climate and socio-economic pressures in
the coming decades. Changes in water use will be driven by
the combined effects of: changes in water availability, changes
in water demand from land, as well as from other competing
sectors including urban, and changes in water management.
Practices that increase the productivity of irrigation water use
– defined as crop output per unit water use – may provide
significant adaptation potential for all land production systems
under future climate change. At the same time, improvements
in irrigation efficiency are critical to ensure the availability of
water both for food production and for competing human and
environmental needs. [WGII 3.5.1]
Several simulation studies suggest the possibility of relative
benefits of adaptation in the land sector with low to moderate
warming, although several response strategies may place
extra stress on water and other environmental resources as
warming increases. Autonomous adaptation actions are defined
as responses that will be implemented by individual farmers,
rural communities and/or farmers’ organisations, depending
on perceived or real climate change in the coming decades,
and without intervention and/or co-ordination by regional and
national governments and international agreements. To this
end, maladaptation, e.g., pressure to cultivate marginal land, or
to adopt unsustainable cultivation practices as yields drop, may
increase land degradation and endanger the biodiversity of both
wild and domestic species, possibly jeopardising future ability
to respond to increasing climate risk later in the century. Planned
adaptation, therefore, including changes in policies, institutions
and dedicated infrastructure, will be needed to facilitate and
maximise long-term benefits of adaptation responses to climate
change. [WGII 5.5]
4.2.4.1 Autonomous adaptation
Options for autonomous adaptation are largely extensions or
intensifications of existing risk management and production
enhancement activities, and are therefore already available
to farmers and communities. These include, with respect to
water:
Box 4.1: Climate change and the fisheries of the lower Mekong – an example of multiple
stresses due to human activity on a megadelta fisheries system. [WGII Box 5.3]
Fisheries are central to the lives of the people, particularly the rural poor, who live in the lower Mekong countries. Twothirds
of the basin’s 60 million people are in some way active in fisheries, which represent about 10% of the GDP of
Cambodia and the Lao People’s Democratic Republic (PDR). There are approximately 1,000 species of fish commonly
found in the river, with many more marine vagrants, making it one of the most prolific and diverse faunas in the world
(MRC, 2003). Recent estimates of the annual catch from capture fisheries alone exceed 2.5 million tonnes (Hortle and
Bush, 2003), with the delta contributing over 30% of this.
Direct effects of climate change will occur due to changing patterns of precipitation, snowmelt and rising sea level, which
will affect hydrology and water quality. Indirect effects will result from changing vegetation patterns that may alter the
food chain and increase soil erosion. It is likely that human impacts on the fisheries (caused by population growth, flood
mitigation, increased water abstractions, changes in land use, and over-fishing) will be greater than the effects of climate,
but the pressures are strongly interrelated.
An analysis of the impact of climate change scenarios on the flow of the Mekong (Hoanh et al., 2004) estimated increased
maximum monthly flows of 35–41% in the basin and 16–19% in the delta (the lower value is for years 2010–2038 and
the higher value for years 2070–2099, compared with 1961–1990 levels). Minimum monthly flows were estimated to
decrease by 17–24% in the basin and 26–29% in the delta. Increased flooding would positively affect fisheries yields, but
a reduction in dry season habitat may reduce the recruitment of some species. However, planned water-management
interventions, primarily dams, are expected to have the opposite effects on hydrology, namely marginally decreasing wetseason
flows and considerably increasing dry-season flows (World Bank, 2004b).
Models indicate that even a modest sea-level rise of 20 cm would cause contour lines of water levels in the Mekong
delta to shift 25 km inland during the flood season and saltwater to move further upstream (although confined within
canals) during the dry season (Wassmann et al., 2004). Inland movement of saltwater would significantly alter the species
composition of fisheries, but may not be detrimental for overall fisheries yields.

adoption of varieties/species with increased resistance to
heat shock and drought;
modification of irrigation techniques, including amount,
timing or technology;
adoption of water-efficient technologies to ‘harvest’ water,
conserve soil moisture (e.g. crop residue retention), and
reduce siltation and saltwater intrusion;
improved water management to prevent waterlogging,
erosion and leaching;
modification of crop calendars, i.e., timing or location of
cropping activities;
implementation of seasonal climate forecasting.
Additional adaptation strategies may involve land-use changes
that take advantage of modified agro-climatic conditions.
[WGII 5.5.1]
A few simulation studies show the importance of irrigation water
as an adaptation technique to reduce climate change impacts. In
general, however, projections suggest that the greatest relative
benefit from adaptation is to be gained under conditions of low
to moderate warming, and that adaptation practices that involve
increased irrigation water use may in fact place additional
stress on water and environmental resources as warming and
evaporative demand increase. [WGII 5.8.1]
Many adaptation strategies in key production sectors other
than crop agriculture have also been explored, although,
without a direct focus on water issues. Adaptation strategies
that may nonetheless affect water use include, for livestock

•
systems, altered rotation of pastures, modification of times of
grazing, alteration of forage and animal species/breeds, altered
integration within mixed livestock/crop systems, including
the use of adapted forage crops, care to ensure adequate water
supplies, and the use of supplementary feeds and concentrates.
Pastoralist coping strategies in semi-arid and arid Kenya and
southern Ethiopia are discussed in Box 4.2. [WGII 5.4.7]
Adaptation strategies for forestry may include changes in
management intensity, species mix, rotation periods, adjusting
to altered wood size and quality, and adjusting fire management
systems. [WGII 5.5.1]
With respect to marine ecosystems, with the exception of
aquaculture and some freshwater fisheries, the exploitation
of natural fish populations precludes the kind of management
adaptations to climate change suggested for the crop, livestock
and forest sectors. Adaptation options thus centre on altering
catch size and effort. The scope for autonomous adaptation
is increasingly restricted as new regulations governing the
exploitation of fisheries and marine ecosystems come into
force. [WGII 5.5.1]
If widely adopted, adaptation strategies in production systems
have substantial potential to offset negative climate change
impacts and take advantage of positive ones. However, there
has been little evaluation of how effective and widely adopted
these adaptations may be, given the complex nature of decision
making; the diversity of responses across regions; time lags
Box 4.2: Pastoralist coping strategies in northern Kenya
and southern Ethiopia. [WGII Box 5.5]
African pastoralism has evolved in adaptation to harsh environments with very high spatial and temporal variability of
rainfall (Ellis, 1995). Several recent studies (Ndikumana et al., 2000; Hendy and Morton, 2001; Oba, 2001; McPeak
and Barrett, 2001; Morton, 2006) have focused on the coping strategies used by pastoralists during recent droughts in
northern Kenya and southern Ethiopia, and the longer-term adaptations that underlie them.
• Mobility remains the most important pastoralist adaptation to spatial and temporal variations in rainfall, and in
drought years many communities make use of fall-back grazing areas unused in ‘normal’ dry seasons because of
distance, land tenure constraints, animal disease problems or conflict. However, encroachment on and individuation
of communal grazing lands, and the desire to settle in order to access human services and food aid, have severely
limited pastoral mobility.
• Pastoralists engage in herd accumulation, and most evidence now suggests that this is a rational form of insurance
against drought.
• A small proportion of pastoralists now hold some of their wealth in bank accounts, and others use informal savings
and credit mechanisms through shop-keepers.
• Pastoralists also use supplementary feed for livestock, purchased or lopped from trees, as a coping strategy; they
intensify animal disease management through indigenous and scientific techniques; they pay for access to water
from powered boreholes.
• Livelihood diversification away from pastoralism in this region predominantly takes the form of shifts into low-income
or environmentally unsustainable occupations such as charcoal production, rather than an adaptive strategy to
reduce ex ante vulnerability.
• A number of intra-community mechanisms distribute both livestock products and the use of live animals to the
destitute, but these appear to be breaking down because of the high levels of covariate risk within communities.
65
Section 4 Climate change and water resources in systems and sectors
in implementation; and possible economic, institutional and
cultural barriers to change. For example, the realisable adaptive
capacity of poor subsistence farming/herding communities is
generally considered to be very low. Likewise, large areas of
forests receive minimal direct human management, limiting
adaptation opportunities. Even in more intensively managed
forests, where adaptation activities may be more feasible, long
time lags between planting and harvesting may complicate the
adoption of effective adaptation strategies. [WGII 5.1.1]
4.2.4.2 Planned adaptation
Planned adaptation solutions should focus on developing new
infrastructure, policies, and institutions that support, facilitate,
co-ordinate and maximise the benefits of new management
and land-use arrangements. This can be achieved in general
through improved governance, including addressing climate
change in development programmes; increasing investment in
irrigation infrastructure and efficient water-use technologies;
ensuring appropriate transport and storage infrastructure;
revising land tenure arrangements (including attention to welldefined
property rights); and establishing accessible, efficiently
functioning markets for products and inputs (including
water pricing schemes) and for financial services (including
insurance). [WGII 5.5]
Planned adaptation and policy co-ordination across multiple
institutions may be necessary to facilitate adaptation to climate
change, in particular where falling yields create pressure to
cultivate marginal land or adopt unsustainable cultivation
practices, increasing both land degradation and the use of
resources, including water. [WGII 5.4.7]
A number of global-, national- and basin-scale adaptation
assessments show that, in general, semi-arid and arid basins
are most vulnerable with respect to water stress. If precipitation
decreases, then demand for irrigation water would make it
impossible to satisfy all other demands. Projected streamflow
changes in the Sacramento-Joaquin and Colorado River Basins
indicate that present-day water demand cannot be fulfilled by
2020, even with adaptive management practices. Increased
irrigation usage would reduce both runoff and downstream flow
(Eheart and Tornil, 1999). [WGII 3.5.1]
Policies aimed at rewarding improvements in irrigation
efficiency, either through market mechanisms or increased
regulations and improved governance, are an important tool for
enhancing adaptation capacity at a regional scale. Unintended
consequences may be increased consumptive water use
upstream, resulting in downstream users being deprived of
water that would otherwise have re-entered the stream as return
flow (Huffaker, 2005). [WGII 3.5.1]
In addition to techniques already available to farmers and
land managers today, new technical options need to be made
available through dedicated research and development efforts,
to be planned and implemented now, in order to augment
overall capacity to respond to climate change in future decades.
Technological options for enhanced R&D include traditional
breeding and biotechnology for improved resistance to climate
stresses such as drought and flooding in crop, forage, livestock,
forest and fisheries species (Box 4.3).
Box 4.3: Will biotechnology assist
agricultural and forest adaptation?
[WGII Box 5.6]
Biotechnology and conventional breeding may help
develop new cultivars with enhanced traits better suited
to adapt to climate change conditions. These include
drought and temperature stress resistance; resistance to
pests and disease, salinity and waterlogging. Additional
opportunities for new cultivars include changes in
phenology or enhanced responses to elevated CO2. With
respect to water, a number of studies have documented
genetic modifications to major crop species (e.g., maize
and soybeans) that increased their water-deficit tolerance
(as reviewed by Drennen et al., 1993; Kishor et al., 1995;
Pilon-Smits et al., 1995; Cheikh et al., 2000), although
this may not extend to the wider range of crop plants.
In general, too little is currently known about how the
desired traits achieved by genetic modification perform
in real farming and forestry applications (Sinclair and
Purcell, 2005).
4.2.4.3 Food security and vulnerability
All four dimensions of food security: namely, food availability
(production and trade), access to food, stability of food
supplies, and food utilisation (the actual processes involved
in the preparation and consumption of food), are likely to be
affected by climate change. Importantly, food security will
depend not only on climate and socio-economic impacts on
food production, but also (and critically so) on changes to trade
flows, stocks, and food aid policy. In particular, climate change
will result in mixed and geographically varying impacts on
food production and, thus, access to food. Tropical developing
countries, many of which have poor land and water resources
and already face serious food insecurity, may be particularly
vulnerable to climate change. [WGII 5.6.5]
Changes in the frequency and intensity of droughts and flooding
will affect the stability of, and access to, critical food supplies.
Rainfall deficits can dramatically reduce both crop yields and
livestock numbers in the semi-arid tropics. Food insecurity and
loss of livelihood would be further exacerbated by the loss of
both cultivated land and coastal fish nurseries as a result of
inundation and coastal erosion in low-lying areas. [WGII 5.6.5]
Climate change may also affect food utilisation through impacts
on environmental resources, with important additional health
consequences. [WGII Chapter 8] For example, decreased water
availability in already water-scarce regions, particularly in the subtropics,
has direct negative implications for both food processing
and consumption. Conversely, the increased risk of flooding of
human settlements in coastal areas from both rising sea levels and
66
Climate change and water resources in systems and sectors Section 4
increased heavy precipitation may increase food contamination and
disease, reducing consumption patterns. [WGII 5.6.5]
4.2.4.4 Water quality issues
In developing countries, the microbiological quality of water
is poor because of the lack of sanitation, lack of proper
treatment methods, and poor health conditions (Lipp et al.,
2001; Jiménez, 2003; Maya et al., 2003; WHO, 2004). Climate
change may impose additional stresses on water quality,
especially in developing countries (Magadza, 2000; Kashyap,
2004; Pachauri, 2004). As yet there are no studies focusing on
micro-organism life cycles relevant to developing countries
under climate change, including a much-needed focus on the
effects of poorly treated wastewater use for irrigation and its
links to endemic outbreaks of helminthiasis (WHO/UNICEF,
2000). [WGII 3.4.4]
About 10% of the world’s population consumes crops irrigated
with untreated or poorly treated wastewater, mostly in
developing countries in Africa, Asia and Latin America. This
number is projected to grow with population and food demand.
[WGII 8.2.5] Increased use of properly treated wastewater for
irrigation is therefore a strategy to combat both water scarcity
and some related health problems. [WGII 3.4.4]
4.2.4.5 Rural communities, sustainable development and
water conflicts
Transboundary water co-operation is recognised as an effective
policy and management tool to improve water management
across large regions sharing common resources. Climate change
and increased water demand in future decades will represent an
added challenge to such framework agreements, increasing the
potential for conflict at the local level. For instance, unilateral
measures for adapting to climate-change-related water
shortages can lead to increased competition for water resources.
Furthermore, shifts in land productivity may lead to a range
of new or modified agricultural systems, necessary to maintain
production, including intensification practices. The latter, in
turn, can lead to additional environmental pressures, resulting
in loss of habitat and reduced biodiversity, siltation, soil erosion
and soil degradation. [WGII 5.7]
Impacts on trade, economic, and environmental development and
land use may also be expected from measures implemented to
substitute fossil fuels through biofuels, such as by the European
Biomass Action Plan. Large-scale biofuel production raises
questions on several issues including fertiliser and pesticide
requirements, nutrient cycling, energy balance, biodiversity
impacts, hydrology and erosion, conflicts with food production,
and the level of financial subsidies required. In fact, the emerging
challenges of future decades include finding balance in the
competition for land and raw materials for the food, forestry
and energy sectors, e.g., devising solutions that ensure food and
local rural development rights while maximising energy and
climate mitigation needs. [LULUCF 4.5.1]
In North America, drought may increase in continental interiors
and production areas may shift northwards (Mills, 1994),
especially for maize and soybean production (Brklacich et al.,
1997). [WGII TAR 15.2.3.1] In Mexico, production losses may
be dominated by droughts, as agro-ecological zones suitable for
maize cultivation decrease (Conde et al., 1997). [WGII TAR
14.2.2.1] Drought is an important issue throughout Australia
for social, political, geographical and environmental reasons. A
change in climate towards drier conditions as a result of lower
rainfall and higher evaporative demand would trigger more
frequent or longer drought declarations under current Australian
drought policy schemes. [WGII TAR 12.5.6]
Water resources are a key vulnerability in Africa for household,
agricultural and industrial uses. In shared river basins, regional
co-operation protocols are needed to minimise both adverse
impacts and the potential for conflicts. For instance, the surface
area of Lake Chad varies from 20,000 km2 during the dry
season to 50,000 km2 during the wet season. While precise
boundaries have been established between Chad, Nigeria,
Cameroon and Niger, sectors of these boundaries that are
located in the rivers that drain into Lake Chad have never been
determined, and additional complications arise as a result of
both flooding and water recession. Similar problems on the
Kovango River between Botswana and Namibia led to military
confrontation. [WGII TAR 10.2.1.2]
Growing water scarcity, increasing population, degradation
of shared freshwater ecosystems and competing demands for
shrinking natural resources distributed over such a huge area
involving so many countries have the potential for creating
bilateral and multilateral conflicts. In semi-arid Africa,
pastoralism is the main economic activity, with pastoral
communities including transnational migrants in search of
new seasonal grazing. In drought situations, such pastoralists
may come into conflict with settled agrarian systems.
[WGII TAR 10.2.1.2]
Asia dominates world aquaculture, with China alone producing
about 70% of all farmed fish, shrimp and shellfish (FAO, 2006).
Fish, an important source of food protein, is critical to food
security in many countries of Asia, particularly among poor
communities in coastal areas. Fish farming requires land and
water, two resources that are already in short supply in many
countries in Asia. Water diversion for shrimp ponds has lowered
groundwater levels noticeably in coastal areas of Thailand.
[WGII TAR 11.2.4.4]
At least 14 major international river watersheds exist in Asia.
Watershed management is challenging in countries with high
population density, which are often responsible for the use of
even the most fragile and unsuitable areas in the watersheds
for cultivation, residential, and other intensive activities. As a
result, in many countries, in particular Bangladesh, Nepal, the
Philippines, Indonesia and Vietnam, many watersheds suffer
badly from deforestation, indiscriminate land conversion,
excessive soil erosion and declining land productivity. In the
67
Section 4 Climate change and water resources in systems and sectors
absence of appropriate adaptation strategies, these watersheds
are highly vulnerable to climate change. [WGII TAR 11.2.3.2]
4.2.4.6 Mitigation
Adaptation responses and mitigation actions may occur
simultaneously in the agricultural and forestry sector; their
efficacy will depend on the patterns of realised climate change
in the coming decades. The associated interactions between
these factors (climate change, adaptation and mitigation) will
frequently involve water resources. [WGIII 8.5, Table 8.9]
Adaptation and mitigation strategies may either exhibit
synergies, where both actions reinforce each other, or be
mutually counter-productive. With respect to water, examples
of adaptation strategies that reduce mitigation options largely
involve irrigation, in relation to the energy costs of delivering
water and the additional greenhouse gas emissions that may
be associated with modified cultivation practices. Using
renewables for water extraction and delivery could, however,
eliminate such conflict. Likewise, some mitigation strategies
may have negative adaptation consequences, such as increasing
dependence on energy crops, which may compete for water
resources, reduce biodiversity, and thus increase vulnerability
to climatic extremes. [WGIII 12.1.4, 12.1.4]
On the other hand, many carbon-sequestration practices
involving reduced tillage, increased crop cover and use of
improved rotation systems, in essence constitute – and were
in fact originally developed as – ‘good-practice’ agro-forestry,
leading to production systems that are more resilient to climate
variability, thus providing good adaptation in the face of
increased pressure on water and soil resources (Rosenzweig
and Tubiello, 2007). [WGII 5.4.2; WGIII 8.5]
4.3.1 Context
Human health, incorporating physical, social and psychological
well-being, depends on an adequate supply of potable water
and a safe environment. Human beings are exposed to climate
change directly through weather patterns (more intense and
frequent extreme events), and indirectly through changes in
water, air, food quality and quantity, ecosystems, agriculture,
livelihoods and infrastructure. [WGII 8.1.1] Due to the very
large number of people that may be affected, malnutrition and
water scarcity may be the most important health consequences
of climate change (see Sections 4.2 and 4.4). [WGII 8.4.2.3]
Population health has improved remarkably over the last
50 years, but substantial inequalities in health persist within
and between countries. The Millennium Development Goal
(MDG) of reducing the mortality rate in children aged under
5 years old by two-thirds by 2015 is unlikely to be reached in
some developing countries. Poor health increases vulnerability
and reduces the capacity of individuals and groups to adapt
4.3 Human health
to climate change. Populations with high rates of disease and
disability cope less successfully with stresses of all kinds,
including those related to climate change. [WGII 8.1.1]
The World Health Organization (WHO) and UNICEF Joint
Monitoring Programme currently estimates that 1.1 billion
people (17% of the global population) lack access to water
resources, where access is defined as the availability of at least
20 litres of water per person per day from an improved water
source within a distance of 1 km. An improved water source is
one that provides ‘safe’ water, such as a household connection
or a bore hole. Nearly two-thirds of the people without access
are in Asia. In sub-Saharan Africa, 42% of the population is
without access to improved water. The WHO estimates that
the total burden of disease due to inadequate water supply,
and poor sanitation and hygiene, is 1.7 million deaths per year.
Health outcomes related to water supply and sanitation are a
focal point of concern for climate change in many countries.
In vulnerable regions, the concentration of risks from both
food and water insecurity can make the impact of any weather
extreme (for example, flood and drought) particularly severe
for the households affected. [WGII 9.2.2]
Changes in climate extremes have the potential to cause severe
impacts on human health. Flooding is expected to become more
severe with climate change, and this will have implications for
human health. Vulnerability to flooding is reduced when the
infrastructure is in place to remove solid waste, manage waste
water, and supply potable water. [WGII 8.2.2]
Lack of water for hygiene is currently responsible for a significant
burden of disease worldwide. A small and unquantified
proportion of this burden can be attributed to climate variability
or climate extremes. ‘Water scarcity’ is associated with multiple
adverse health outcomes, including diseases associated with
water contaminated with faecal and other hazardous substances
(e.g., parasites).
Childhood mortality and morbidity due to diarrhoea in lowincome
countries, especially in sub-Saharan Africa, remains
high despite improvements in care and the use of oral
rehydration therapy. Climate change is expected to increase
water scarcity, but it is difficult to assess what this means at the
household level for the availability of water, and therefore for
health and hygiene. There is a lack of information linking largescale
modelling of climate change to small-scale impacts at the
population or household level. Furthermore, any assessments of
future health impacts via changes in water availability need to
take into account future improvements in access to ‘safe’ water.
[WGII 8.2.5, 8.4.2.2]
4.3.1.1 Implications for drinking-water quality
The relationship between rainfall, river flow and contamination
of the water supply is highly complex, as discussed below both
for piped water supplies and for direct contact with surface
waters. If river flows are reduced as a consequence of less
rainfall, then their ability to dilute effluent is also reduced
– leading to increased pathogen or chemical loading. This
68
Climate change and water resources in systems and sectors Section 4
could represent an increase in human exposures or, in places
with piped water supplies, an increased challenge to water
treatment plants. During the dry summer of 2003, low flows in
the Netherlands resulted in apparent changes in water quality
(Senhorst and Zwolsman, 2005). The marked seasonality of
cholera outbreaks in the Amazon was associated with low river
flow in the dry season (Gerolomo and Penna, 1999), probably
due to high pathogen concentrations in pools. [WGII 8.2.5]
Drainage and storm water management is important in lowincome
urban communities, as blocked drains can cause
flooding and increased transmission of vector-borne diseases
(Parkinson and Butler, 2005). Cities with combined sewer
overflows can experience increased sewage contamination
during flood events. [WGII 8.2.5]
In high-income countries, rainfall and runoff events may
increase the total microbial load in watercourses and drinkingwater
reservoirs, although the linkage to cases of human disease
is less certain because the concentration of contaminants is
diluted. The seasonal contamination of surface water in early
spring in North America and Europe may explain some of the
seasonality in sporadic cases of water-borne diseases such
as cryptosporidiosis and campylobacteriosis. A significant
proportion of notified water-borne disease outbreaks are
related to heavy precipitation events, often in conjunction with
treatment failures. [WGII 14.2.5, 8.2.5]
Freshwater harmful algal blooms (HABs) produce toxins that
can cause human diseases. The occurrence of such blooms in
surface waters (rives and lakes) may increase due to higher
temperatures. However, the threat to human health is very low,
as direct contact with blooms is generally restricted. There
is a low risk of contamination of water supplies with algal
toxins but the implications for human health are uncertain.
[WGII 8.2.4, 3.4.4]
In areas with poor water supply infrastructure, the transmission
of enteric pathogens peaks during the rainy season. In addition,
higher temperatures were found to be associated with increased
episodes of diarrhoeal disease (Checkley et al., 2000; Singh et
al., 2001; Vasilev, 2003; Lama et al., 2004). The underlying
incidence of these diseases is associated with poor hygiene and
lack of access to safe water. [WGII 8.2.5]
4.3.1.2 Disasters, including wind storms and floods
The previous sections have described how climate change will
affect the risk of water-related disasters, including glacial lake
outburst floods (GLOFs), increased storm surge intensity, and
changes in flood risk (see Section 3.2) including flash flooding
and urban flooding, with some reductions in risk of spring
snowmelt floods. [WGII 3.4.3] Floods have a considerable
impact on health both in terms of number of deaths and disease
burden, and also in terms of damage to the health infrastructure.
[WGII 8.2.2] While the risk of infectious disease following
flooding is generally low in high-income countries, populations
with poor infrastructure and high burdens of infectious disease
often experience increased rates of diarrhoeal diseases after
flood events. There is increasing evidence of the impact that
climate-related disasters have on mental health, with people
who have suffered the effects of floods experiencing long-term
anxiety and depression. [WGII 8.2.2, 16.4.5]
Flooding and heavy rainfall may lead to contamination
of water with chemicals, heavy metals or other hazardous
substances, either from storage or from chemicals already in
the environment (e.g., pesticides). Increases in both population
density and industrial development in areas subject to natural
disasters increase both the probability of future disasters and
the potential for mass human exposure to hazardous materials
during these events. [WGII 8.2.2]
4.3.1.3 Drought and infectious disease
For a few infectious diseases, there is an established rainfall
association that is not related to the consumption of drinkingwater
(quality or quantity) or arthropod vectors. The spatial
distribution, intensity and seasonality of meningococcal
(epidemic) meningitis in the Sahelian region of Africa is
related to climatic and environmental factors, particularly
drought, although the causal mechanism is not well understood.
The geographical distribution of meningitis has expanded
in West Africa in recent years, which may be attributable to
environmental change driven both by land-use changes and by
regional climate change. [WGII 8.2.3.1]
4.3.1.4 Dust storms
Windblown dust originating in desert regions of Africa, the
Arabian Peninsula, Mongolia, central Asia and China can
affect air quality and population health in distant areas. When
compared with non-dust weather conditions, dust can carry
large concentrations of respirable particles; trace elements
that can affect human health; fungal spores; and bacteria.
[WGII 8.2.6.4]
4.3.1.5 Vector-borne diseases
Climate influences the spatial distribution, intensity of
transmission, and seasonality of diseases transmitted by
vectors (e.g., malaria) and diseases that have water snails as an
intermediate host (e.g., schistosomiasis). [WGII 8.2.8] During
droughts, mosquito activity is reduced but, if transmission
drops significantly, the population of non-immune individuals
may increase. In the long term, the incidence of mosquito-borne
diseases such as malaria decreases because mosquito abundance
is reduced, although epidemics may still occur when suitable
climate conditions occur. [WGII 8.2.3.1]
The distribution of schistosomiasis, a water-related parasitic
disease with aquatic snails as intermediate hosts, is influenced
by climate factors in some locations, For example, the
observed change in the distribution of schistosomiasis in China
69
Section 4 Climate change and water resources in systems and sectors
over the past decade may in part reflect the recent warming
trend. Irrigation schemes have also been shown to increase
the incidence of schistosomiasis, when appropriate control
measures are not implemented. [WGII 8.2.8.3]
4.3.2 Observations
There is a wide range of driving forces that can affect and
modify the impact of climate change on human health outcomes.
Because of the complexity of the association between climate
factors and disease, it is often not possible to attribute changes
in specific disease patterns to observed climate changes.
Furthermore, health data series of sufficient quality and length
are rarely available for such studies. There are no published
studies of water-related impacts on health that describe patterns
of disease that are robustly attributed to observed climate change.
However, there are several reports of adaptive responses in the
water sector designed to reduce the impacts of climate change.
[WGII Chapter 7]
Observed trends in water-related disasters (floods, wind
storms) and the role of climate change are discussed elsewhere.
[WGII 1.3]
4.3.3 Projections
Climate change is expected to have a range of adverse effects
on populations where the water and sanitation infrastructure is
inadequate to meet local needs. Access to safe water remains an
extremely important global health issue. More than two billion
people live in the dry regions of the world, and these people
suffer more than others from malnutrition, infant mortality
and diseases related to contaminated or insufficient water.
Water scarcity constitutes a serious constraint to sustainable
development (Rockstrom, 2003). [WGII 8.2.5, 8.4.2.2]
4.3.4 Adaptation, vulnerability and sustainable
development
Weak public health systems and limited access to primary health
care contribute both to high levels of vulnerability and to low
adaptive capacity for hundreds of millions of people. [WGII
8.6] Fundamental constraints exist in low-income countries,
where population health will depend upon improvements in
the health, water, agriculture, transport, energy and housing
sectors. Poverty and weak governance are the most serious
obstacles to effective adaptation. Despite economic growth,
low-income countries are likely to remain vulnerable over the
medium term, with fewer options than high-income countries
for adapting to climate change. Therefore, if adaptation
strategies are to be effective, they should be designed in the
context of the development, environment and health policies in
place in the target area. Many options that can be used to reduce
future vulnerability are of value in adapting to current climate,
and can also be used to achieve other environmental and social
objectives. [WGII 8.6.3]
The observed effects of climate change on water resource
quantity and quality have been discussed in detail in Sections 4.2
and 4.3. This section summarises the main points and describes
their implications for water supply and sanitation services.
4.4.1 Context
Statistics on present-day access to safe water have already been
provided in Section 4.3.1. Access to safe water is now regarded
as a universal human right. However, the world is facing
increasing problems in providing water services, particularly in
developing countries. There are several reasons for this, which
are not necessarily linked to climate change. A lack of available
water, a higher and more uneven water demand resulting
from population growth in concentrated areas, an increase in
urbanisation, more intense use of water to improve general
well-being, and the challenge to improve water governance, are
variables that already pose a tremendous challenge to providing
satisfactory water services. In this context, climate change
simply represents an additional burden for water utilities, or
any other organisation providing water services, in meeting
customers’ needs. It is difficult to identify climate change
effects at a local level, but the observed effects combined with
projections provide a useful basis to prepare for the future.
4.4.2 Observations
Table 4.1 summarises possible linkages between climate change
and water services.
The potential adverse health effects of any adaptation strategy
should be evaluated before that strategy is implemented.
For example, a micro-dam and irrigation programmes have
been shown to increase local malaria mortality. [WGII 8.6.4]
Measures to combat water scarcity, such as the reuse of
untreated or partially treated wastewater for irrigation, also
have implications for human health. Irrigation is currently an
important determinant of the spread of infectious diseases such
as malaria and schistosomiasis (Sutherst, 2004). Strict waterquality
guidelines for wastewater irrigation are designed to
prevent health risks from pathogenic organisms, and to guarantee
crop quality (Steenvoorden and Endreny, 2004). Some diseases,
such as helminthiasis, are transmitted by consuming crops
irrigated with polluted water or wastewater and, in the rural
and peri-urban areas of most low-income countries, the use of
sewage and wastewater for irrigation, a common practice, is a
source of faecal–oral disease transmission. At present, at least
one-tenth of the world’s population consumes crops irrigated
with wastewater. However, increasing water scarcity and food
demand, coupled with poor sanitation, will facilitate the use of
low-quality water. If such problems are to be controlled, then
programmes of wastewater treatment and planned wastewater
reuse need to be developed. [WGII 8.6.4, 3.4.4]

Table 4.1: Observed effects of climate change and its observed/possible impacts on water services. [WGII Chapter 3]
4.4.3 Projections
Reduced water availability may result from:
decreased flows in basins fed by shrinking glaciers and
longer and more frequent dry seasons,
decreased summer precipitation leading to a reduction
of stored water in reservoirs fed with seasonal rivers (du
Plessis et al., 2003),
interannual precipitation variability and seasonal shifts in
streamflow,
reductions in inland groundwater levels,
the increase in evapotranspiration as a result of higher
air temperatures, lengthening of the growing season and
increased irrigation water usage,
salinisation (Chen et al., 2004).
According to projections, the number of people at risk from
increasing water stress will be between 0.4 billion and 1.7 billion
by the 2020s, between 1.0 billion and 2.0 billion by the 2050s
and between 1.1 billion and 3.2 billion by the 2080s (Arnell,
2004), the range being due to the different SRES scenarios
considered. [WGII 3.2, 3.5.1]
In some areas, low water availability will lead to groundwater
over-exploitation and, with it, increasing costs of supplying water
for any use as a result of the need to pump water from deeper
and further away. Additionally, groundwater over-exploitation
may lead in some cases to water quality deterioration. For some
regions of India, Bangladesh, China, north Africa, Mexico and
Argentina, there are more than 100 million people suffering
from arsenic poisoning and fluorosis (a disease of the teeth
a.
b.
c.
d.
e.
f.
or bones caused by excessive consumption of fluoride
in drinking water) (UN, 2003); this can result in an even
worse situation if people are forced to use more water from
groundwater as a result of the lack of reliable surface water
sources. [WGII 3.4.4]
Increasing water scarcity combined with increased food demand
and/or water use for irrigation as a result of higher temperatures
are likely to lead to enhanced water reuse. Areas with low
sanitation coverage might be found to be practising (as a new
activity or to a greater degree) uncontrolled water reuse (reuse
that is performed using polluted water or even wastewater).
[WGII 3.3.2, 8.6.4]
Water quality deterioration as result of flow variation. Where a
reduction in water resources is expected, a higher water pollutant
concentration will result from a lower dilution capacity. [WGII
3.4.4, 14.4.1] At the same time, increased water flows will
displace and transport diverse compounds from the soil to water
resources through fluvial erosion. [WGII 3.4]
Similarly, an increase in morbidity and mortality rates from
water-borne diseases for both more humid and drier scenarios
is expected, owing to an insufficient supply of potable water
(Kovats et al., 2005; Ebi et al., 2006), and the greater presence
of pathogens conveyed by high water flows during extreme
precipitation. Increased precipitation may also result in higher
turbidity and nutrient loadings in water. The water utility of
New York City has identified heavy precipitation events as
one of its major climate-change-related concerns because they
71
Section 4 Climate change and water resources in systems and sectors
can raise turbidity levels in some of the city’s main reservoirs
by up to 100 times the legal limit for source quality at the
utility’s intakes, requiring substantial additional treatment and
monitoring costs (Miller and Yates, 2006). [WGII 3.5.1]
Increased runoff. In some regions, more water will be available
which, considering the present global water situation, will
be generally beneficial. Nevertheless, provisions need to be
made to use this to the world’s advantage. For example, while
increased runoff in eastern and southern Asia is expected as a
result of climate change, water shortages in these areas may not
be addressed, given a lack of resources for investing in the new
storage capacity required to capture the additional water and to
enable its use during the dry season. [WGII 3.5.1]
Higher precipitation in cities may affect the performance
of sewer systems; uncontrolled surcharges may introduce
microbial and chemical pollutants to water resources that are
difficult to handle through the use of conventional drinkingwater
treatment processes. Several studies have shown that the
transmission of enteric pathogens resistant to chlorination, such
as Cryptosporidium, is high during the rainy season (Nchito
et al., 1998; Kang et al., 2001). This is a situation that could
be magnified in developing countries, where health levels
are lower and the pathogen content in wastewater is higher
(Jiménez, 2003). In addition, extreme precipitation leading to
floods puts water infrastructure at risk. During floods, water and
wastewater treatment facilities are often out of service, leaving
the population with no sanitary protection. [WGII 3.2, 3.4.4,
8.2.5]
Water quality impairment as result of higher temperatures.
Warmer temperatures, combined with higher phosphorus
concentrations in lakes and reservoirs, promote algal blooms
that impair water quality through undesirable colour, odour and
taste, and possible toxicity to humans, livestock and wildlife.
Dealing with such polluted water has a high cost with the
available technology, even for water utilities from developed
countries (Environment Canada, 2001). Higher water
temperatures will also enhance the transfer of volatile and semivolatile
pollutants (ammonia, mercury, PCBs (polychlorinated
biphenyls), dioxins, pesticides) from water and wastewater to
the atmosphere. [WGII 3.4.4]
Increased salinisation. The salinisation of water supplies from
coastal aquifers due to sea-level rise is an important issue, as
around one-quarter of the world’s population live in coastal
regions that are generally water-scarce and undergoing rapid
population growth (Small and Nicholls, 2003; Millennium
Ecosystem Assessment, 2005b). Salinisation can also affect
inland aquifers due to a reduction in groundwater recharge
(Chen et al., 2004). [WGII 3.2, 3.4.2]
The populations that will be most affected by climate change
with respect to water services are those located in the already
water-stressed basins of Africa, the Mediterranean region, the
Near East, southern Asia, northern China, Australia, the USA,
central and northern Mexico, north-eastern Brazil and the
west coast of South America. Those particularly at risk will be
populations living in megacities, rural areas strongly dependent
on groundwater, small islands, and in glacier- or snowmeltfed
basins (more than one-sixth of the world’s population
live in snowmelt basins). Problems will be more critical in
economically depressed areas, where water stress will be
enhanced by socio-economic factors (Alcamo and Henrichs,
2002; Ragab and Prudhomme, 2002). [WGII 3.3.2, 3.5.1]
4.4.4 Adaptation, vulnerability and sustainable
development
Given the problems envisaged above, it is important for water
utilities located in regions at risk to plan accordingly. Most
water supply systems are well able to cope with the relatively
small changes in mean temperature and precipitation that are
projected to occur in the decades ahead, except at the margin
where a change in the mean requires a change in the system
design or the technology used; e.g., where reduced precipitation
makes additional reservoirs necessary (Harman et al., 2005),
or leads to saline intrusion into the lower reaches of a river, or
requires new water treatment systems to remove salts. A recent
example of adaptation is in southern Africa (Ruosteenoja et
al. 2003), where the city of Beira in Mozambique is already
extending its 50 km pumping main a further 5 km inland to be
certain of fresh water. [WGII 7.4.2.3.1]
Water services are usually provided using engineered systems.
These systems are designed using safety factors and have a life
expectancy of 20–50 years (for storage reservoirs it can be even
longer). Reviews of the resilience of water supplies and the
performance of water infrastructure have typically been done by
using observed conditions alone. The use of climate projections
should also be considered, especially in cases involving systems
that deal with floods and droughts.
Decrease in water availability. Except for a few industrialised
countries, water use is increasing around the world due to
population and economic growth, lifestyle changes and
expanded water supply systems. [WGII 3.3] It is important to
implement efficient water-use programmes in regions where
water availability is likely to decrease, as large investments
might be required to ensure adequate supplies, either by
building new storage reservoirs or by using alternative water
sources. Reductions in water use can delay, or even eliminate,
the need for additional infrastructure. One of the quickest ways
to increase water availability is through minimising water losses
in urban networks and in irrigation systems. Other alternatives
for reducing the need for new water supplies include rainwater
harvesting as well as controlled reuse. [WGII 3.5, 3.6]
Lower water quality caused by flow variations. The protection
of water resources is an important, cost-effective strategy for
facing future problems concerning water quality. While this
is a common practice for some countries, new and innovative
approaches to water quality management are required around
the world. One such approach is the implementation of water
safety plans (WSP) to perform a comprehensive assessment
72
Climate change and water resources in systems and sectors Section 4
and management of risks from the catchment to consumer, as
proposed by the WHO (2005). Also, the design and operation
of water and wastewater treatment plants should be reviewed
periodically, particularly in vulnerable areas, to ensure or
increase their reliability and their ability to cope with uncertain
flow variations.
Desalinisation. Water treatment methods are an option for
dealing with increasing salt content in places at risk, such as
highly urbanised coastal areas relying on aquifers sensitive to
saline intrusion. At present, available technologies are based
mostly on membranes and are more costly than conventional
methods for the treatment of freshwater supplies. The
desalination cost for seawater is estimated at around US$1/m3,
for brackish water it is US$0.60/m3 (Zhou and Tol, 2005), and
freshwater chlorination costs US$0.02/m3. Fortunately the cost
of desalinisation has been falling, although it still has a high
energy demand. Desalinisation costs need to be compared with
the costs of extending pipelines and eventually relocating water
treatment works in order to have access to freshwater. As a rough
working rule, the cost of construction of the abstraction and
treatment works and the pumping main for an urban settlement’s
water supply is about half the cost of the entire system. [WGII
7.5] However, in the densely populated coastal areas of Egypt,
China, Bangladesh, India and south-east Asia, desalination
costs may still be prohibitive. [WGII 3.5.1] If the use of
desalination increases in the future, environmental side-effects
such as impingement on and entrainment of marine organisms
by seawater desalination plants, and the safe disposal of highly
concentrated brines that can also contain other chemicals, will
need to be addressed. [WGII 3.3.2]
More and different approaches for coping with wastewater. For
sewers and wastewater treatment plants, strategies for coping
with higher and more variable flows will be needed. These
should include new approaches such as the use of decentralised
systems, the construction of separate sewers, the treatment of
combined sewer overflows (i.e., the mixture of wastewater
and runoff in cities), and injecting rainwater into the subsoil.
Given the high cost involved in increasing the capacity of
urban wastewater treatment plants, appropriately financed
schemes should be put in place to consider local conditions. For
rural areas, sanitation coverage is generally too low, and local
action plans need to be formulated using low-cost technologies,
depending on the locality and involving the community. [WGII
7.4.2.3]
Better administration of water resources. As well as considering
the adaptation measures already discussed, integrated water
management, including climate change as an additional
variable, should be considered as an efficient tool. Reduced,
increased or a greater variability in water availability will
lead to conflicts between water users (agriculture, industries,
ecosystems and settlements). The institutions governing water
allocation will play a major role in determining the overall
social impact of a change in water availability, as well as the
distribution of gains and losses across different sectors of
society. Institutional settings need to find better ways to allocate
water, using principles – such as equity and efficiency – that
may be politically difficult to implement in practice. These
settings also need to consider the management of international
basins and surface and groundwater basins. [WGII 3.5.1]
To confront the additional stress induced by climate change,
public participation in water planning will be necessary,
particularly in regard to changing views on the value of water,
the importance and role that water reuse will play in the future,
and the contribution that society is willing to make to the
mitigation of water-related impacts.
To implement policy based on the principles of integrated
water management, better co-ordination between different
governmental entities should be sought, and institutional
and legal frameworks should be reviewed to facilitate the
implementation of adaptation measures. Climate change will
be felt by all stakeholders involved in the water management
process, including users. Therefore, all should be aware of its
possible impacts on the system in order to take appropriate
decisions and be prepared to pay the costs involved. In the case
of wastewater disposal norms, for example, the overall strategy
used will possibly need to be reviewed, as long as it is based
on the self-purification capacity of surface water, which will be
reduced by higher temperatures. [WGII 3.4.4]
Developed countries. In developed countries, drinking-water
receives extensive treatment before it is supplied to the consumer
and the wastewater treatment level is high. Such benefits, as
well as proper water source protection, need to be maintained
under future climatic change, even if additional cost is to be
incurred, for instance by including additional water treatment
requirements. For small communities or rural areas, measures
to be considered may include water source protection as a better
cost–benefit option.
Developing countries. Unfortunately, some countries may not
have sufficient economic resources to face the challenges posed
by climate change. Poor countries already need additional
resources to overcome problems with inadequate infrastructure,
and thus they will be more vulnerable to projected impacts
on water quantity and quality, unless low-cost options and
affordable finance options are available.
Because several of the already identified adaptation and
mitigation options are simply not viable, it is expected that
developing countries may have to adapt by using unsustainable
practices such as increasing groundwater over-exploitation
or reusing a greater amount of untreated wastewater. These
‘solutions’ are attractive because they can easily be implemented
at an individual, personal, level. Therefore, low-cost and safe
options which do not necessarily imply conventional solutions
need to be developed, particularly to provide water services for
poor communities that do not even have formal water utilities in
73
Section 4 Climate change and water resources in systems and sectors
Changes in water availability, water quality, precipitation
characteristics, and the likelihood and magnitude of flooding
events are expected to play a major role in driving the impacts
of climate change on human settlements and infrastructure
(Shepherd et al., 2002; Klein et al., 2003; London Climate
Change Partnership, 2004; Sherbinin et al., 2006). These impacts
will vary regionally. In addition, impacts will depend greatly on
the geophysical setting, level of socio-economic development,
water allocation institutions, nature of the local economic
base, infrastructure characteristics and other stressors. These
include pollution, ecosystem degradation, land subsidence
(due either to loss of permafrost, natural isostatic processes,
or human activities such as groundwater use) and population
growth (UNWWAP, 2003, 2006; Faruqui et al., 2001; UNDP,
2006). Globally, locations most at risk of freshwater supply
problems due to climate change are small islands, arid and
semi-arid developing countries, regions whose freshwater is
supplied by rivers fed by glacial melt or seasonal snowmelt,
and countries with a high proportion of coastal lowlands and
coastal megacities, particularly in the Asia–Pacific region
(Alcamo and Henrichs, 2002; Ragab and Prudhomme, 2002).
[WGII 6.4.2, 20.3]
Growing population density in high-risk locations, such as
coastal and riverine areas, is very likely to increase vulnerability
to the water-related impacts of climate change, including flood
and storm damages and water quality degradation as a result
of saline intrusion. [WGII 6.4.2, 7.4.2.4] Settlements whose
economies are closely linked to a climate-sensitive waterdependent
activity, such as irrigated agriculture, water-related
tourism and snow skiing, are likely to be especially vulnerable
to the water resource impacts of climate change (Elsasser and
Burki, 2002; Hayhoe et al., 2004). [WGII 7.4.3, 12.4.9]
Infrastructure associated with settlements includes buildings,
transportation networks, coastal facilities, water supply and
wastewater infrastructure, and energy facilities. Infrastructure
impacts include both direct damages, for example as a result
of flood events or structural instabilities caused by rainfall
erosion or changes in the water table, as well as impacts on
the performance, cost and adequacy of facilities that were not
many instances. Unfortunately, there are few studies available
on this issue. [WGII 3.4.3, 8.6.4]
In summary, climate change can have positive and negative
impacts on water services. It is important, therefore, to
be aware of its consequences at a local level and to plan
accordingly. At the present time, only some water utilities in
a few countries, including the Netherlands, the UK, Canada
and the USA, have begun to consider the implications of
climate change in the context of flood control and water
supply management. [WGII 3.6]
4.5 Settlements and infrastructure
designed for the climate conditions projected to prevail in the
future. [WGII 3.4.3, 3.5, 7.4.2.3]
4.5.1 Settlements
Many human settlements currently lack access to adequate,
safe water supplies. The World Health Organization estimates
that 1.1 billion people worldwide do not have access to safe
drinking water, and 2.4 billion are without access to adequate
sanitation (WHO/UNICEF, 2000). Poor urban households
frequently do not have networked water supply access, and
thus are especially vulnerable to rising costs for drinking water
(UN-HABITAT, 2003; UNCHS, 2003, 2006; UNDP, 2006).
For example, in Jakarta, some households without regular
water service reportedly spend up to 25% of their income
on water and, during the hot summer of 1998 in Amman,
Jordan, refugee-camp residents who were not connected to the
municipal water system paid much higher rates for water than
other households (Faruqui et al., 2001). The impacts of climate
change on water availability and source water quality are very
likely to make it increasingly difficult to address these problems,
especially in areas where water stress is projected to increase
due to declining runoff coupled with increasing population.
[WGII 3.5.1] Rapidly growing settlements in semi-arid areas of
developing countries, particularly poor communities that have
limited adaptive capacity, are especially vulnerable to declines
in water availability and associated increases in the costs of
securing reliable supplies (Millennium Ecosystem Assessment,
2005b). [WGII 7.4]
In both developed and developing countries, the expected
continuation of rapid population growth in coastal cities will
increase human exposure to flooding and related storm damages
from hurricanes and other coastal storms. [WGII 7.4.2.4] That
very development is contributing to the loss of deltaic wetlands
that could buffer the storm impacts. [WGII 6.4.1.2] In addition,
much of the growth is occurring in relatively water-scarce
coastal areas, thus exacerbating imbalances between water
demand and availability (Small and Nicholls, 2003; Millennium
Ecosystem Assessment, 2005b).
4.5.2 Infrastructure
4.5.2.1 Transportation networks
Flooding due to sea-level rise and increases in the intensity of
extreme weather events (such as storms and hurricanes) pose
threats to transportation networks in some areas. These include
localised street-flooding, flooding of subway systems, and flood
and landslide-related damages to bridges, roads and railways.
For example, in London, which has the world’s oldest subway
system, more intense rainfall events are predicted to increase the
risk of flooding in the Underground and highways. This would
necessitate improvements in the drainage systems of these
networks (Arkell and Darch, 2006). Similarly, recent research
on the surface transportation system of the Boston Metropolitan
Area has predicted that increased flooding will cause increased
trip delays and cancellations, which will result in lost work74
Climate change and water resources in systems and sectors Section 4
days, sales and production (Suarez et al., 2005). However, those
costs would be small in comparison to flood-related damages
to Boston’s transportation infrastructure (Kirshen et al., 2006).
[WGII 7.4.2.3.3] An example of present-day vulnerability that
could be exacerbated by increased precipitation intensity is
the fact that India’s Konkan Railway annually suffers roughly
US$1 million in damages due to landslides during the rainy
season (Shukla et al., 2005). [WGII 7.4.2.3.3]
4.5.2.2 Built environment
Flooding, landslides and severe storms (such as hurricanes)
pose the greatest risks for damages to buildings in both
developed and developing countries, because housing and other
assets are increasingly located in coastal areas, on slopes, in
ravines and other risk-prone sites (Bigio, 2003; UN-Habitat ,
2003). Informal settlements within urban areas of developingcountry
cities are especially vulnerable, as they tend to be built
on relatively hazardous sites that are susceptible to floods,
landslides and other climate-related disasters (Cross, 2001;
UN-Habitat , 2003). [WGII 7.4.2.4]
Other impacts on buildings include the potential for accelerated
weathering due to increased precipitation intensity and storm
frequency (e.g., Graves and Phillipson, 2000), and increased
structural damage due to water table decline and subsidence
(e.g., Sanders and Phillipson, 2003), or due to the impacts of a
rising water table (Kharkina, 2004). [WGII 3.5]
Another area of concern is the future performance of stormwater
drainage systems. In regions affected by increasingly
intense storms, the capacity of these systems will need to be
increased to prevent local flooding and the resulting damages to
buildings and other infrastructure (UK Water Industry Research,
2004). [WGII 7.6.4]
4.5.2.3 Coastal infrastructure
Infrastructure in low-lying coastal areas is vulnerable to damage
from sea-level rise, flooding, hurricanes and other storms. The
stock of coastal infrastructure at risk is increasing rapidly as a
result of the continuing growth of coastal cities and expanding
tourism in areas such as the Caribbean (e.g., Hareau et al., 1999;
Lewsey et al., 2004; Kumar, 2006). In some areas, damage
costs due to an increase in sea level have been estimated, and
are often substantial. For example, in Poland, estimated damage
costs due to a possible rise in sea level of 1 metre by 2100 are
US$30 billion, due to impacts on urban areas, sewers, ports and
other infrastructure (Zeidler, 1997). The same study estimated
that a projected 1 metre rise in sea level in Vietnam would
subject 17 million people to flooding and cause damages of up
to US$17 billion, with substantial impacts penetrating inland
beyond the coastal zone. [WGII 6.3, 6.4, 6.5]
4.5.2.4 Energy infrastructure
Hydrological changes will directly affect the potential output
of hydro-electric facilities – both those currently existing and
possible future projects. There are large regional differences in
the extent of hydropower development. In Africa, where little
of the continent’s hydropower potential has been developed,
climate change simulations for the Batoka Gorge hydro-electric
scheme on the Zambezi River projected a significant reduction
in river flows (e.g., a decline in mean monthly flow from
3.21×109 m3 to 2.07×109 m3) and declining power production
(e.g., a decrease in mean monthly production from 780 GWh
to 613 GWh) (Harrison and Whittington, 2002). A reduction in
hydro-electric power is also anticipated elsewhere, where and
when river flows are expected to decline (e.g., Whittington and
Gundry, 1998; Magadza, 2000). In some other areas, hydroelectric
generation is projected to increase. For example,
estimates for the 2070s, under the IS92a emissions scenario,
indicate that the electricity production potential of hydropower
plants existing at the end of the 20th century would increase by
15–30% in Scandinavia and northern Russia, where between
19% (Finland) and almost 100% (Norway) of the electricity
is produced by hydropower (Lehner et al., 2005). [WGII 3.5]
Other energy infrastructure, such as power transmission lines,
offshore drilling rigs and pipelines, may be vulnerable to damage
from flooding and more intense storm events. [WGII 7.5] In
addition, problems with cooling water availability (because of
reduced quantity or higher water temperature) could disrupt
energy supplies by adversely affecting energy production in
thermal and nuclear power plants (EEA, 2005).
4.5.3 Adaptation
The impacts of changes in the frequency of floods and droughts
or in the quantity, quality or seasonal timing of water availability
could be tempered by appropriate infrastructure investments,
and by changes in water and land-use management. Coordinated
planning may be valuable because there are many
points at which impacts on the different infrastructures interact.
For instance, the failure of flood defences can interrupt power
supplies, which in turn puts water and wastewater pumping
stations out of action.
Improved incorporation of current climate variability into waterrelated
management would make adaptation to future climate
change easier (very high confidence). [WGII 3.6] For example,
managing current flood risks by maintaining green areas and
natural buffers around streams in urban settings would also help
to reduce the adverse impacts of future heavier storm runoff.
However, any of these responses will entail costs, not only in
monetary terms but also in terms of societal impacts, including
the need to manage potential conflicts between different interest
groups. [WGII 3.5]
4.6.1 Context
Climate and water resources impact on several secondary and
tertiary sectors of the economy such as insurance, industry,
tourism and transportation. Water-related effects of climate
change in these sectors can be positive as well as negative,
4.6 Economy: insurance, tourism,
iiiiiiiindustry, transportation
75
Section 4 Climate change and water resources in systems and sectors
but extreme climate events and other abrupt changes tend to
affect human systems more severely than gradual change, partly
because they offer less time for adaptation. [WGII 7.1.3]
Global losses reveal rapidly rising costs due to extreme weatherrelated
events since the 1970s. One study has found that, while
the dominant signal remains that of the significant increases in
the values of exposure at risk, once losses are normalised for
exposure, there still remains an underlying rising trend. For
specific regions and perils, including the most extreme floods
on some of the largest rivers, there is evidence for an increase
in occurrence. [WGII 1.3.8.5]
To demonstrate the large impact of climate variability on
insurance losses, flooding is responsible for 10% of weatherrelated
insurance losses globally. Drought also has an impact:
data from the UK show a lagged relationship between the cost
of insurance claims related to subsidence and (low) summer
rainfall. However, in developing countries, losses due to
extreme events are measured more in terms of human life
than they are in terms of insurance. For example, the Sahelian
drought, despite its high severity, had only a small impact
on the formal financial sector, due to the low penetration of
insurance. [WGII TAR 8.2.3]
4.6.2 Socio-economic costs, mitigation,
adaptation, vulnerability, sustainable
development
Of all the possible water-related impacts on transportation,
the greatest cost is that of flooding. The cost of delays and
lost trips is relatively small compared with damage to the
infrastructure and to other property (Kirshen et al., 2006). In
the last 10 years, there have been four cases when flooding of
urban underground rail systems has caused damages of more
than €10 million (US$13 million) and numerous cases of lesser
damage (Compton et al., 2002). [WGII 7.4.2.3.3]
Industrial sectors are generally thought to be less vulnerable to
the impacts of climate change than such sectors as agriculture.
Among the major exceptions are industrial facilities located in
climate-sensitive areas (such as floodplains) (Ruth et al., 2004)
and those dependent on climate-sensitive commodities such as
food-processing plants. [WGII 7.4.2.1]
The specific insurance risk coverage currently available
within a country will have been shaped by the impact of past
catastrophes. Because of the high concentration of losses due to
catastrophic floods, private-sector flood insurance is generally
restricted (or even unavailable) so that, in several countries,
governments have developed alternative state-backed flood
insurance schemes (Swiss Re, 1998). [WGII 7.4.2.2.4]
For the finance sector, climate-change-related risks are
increasingly considered for specific ‘susceptible’ sectors such as
hydro-electric projects, irrigation and agriculture, and tourism
(UNEP/GRID-Arendal, 2002). [WGII 7.4.2.2]
Effects of climate change on tourism include changes in the
availability of water, which could be positive or negative (Braun
et al., 1999; Uyarra et al., 2005). Warmer climates open up the
possibility of extending exotic environments (such as palm
trees in western Europe), which could be considered by some
tourists as positive but could lead to a spatial extension and
amplification of water- and vector-borne diseases. Droughts
and the extension of arid environments (and the effects of
extreme weather events) might discourage tourists, although
it is not entirely clear what they consider to be unacceptable.
[WGII 7.4.2.2.3] Areas dependent on the availability of snow
(e.g., for winter tourism) are among those most vulnerable to
global warming. [WGII 11.4.9, 12.4.9, 14.4.7]
Transportation of bulk freight by inland waterways, such as
the Rhine, can be disrupted during floods and droughts (Parry,
2000). [WGII 7.4.2.2.2]
Insurance spreads risk and assists with adaptation, while
managing insurance funds has implications for mitigation.
[WGII 18.5] Adaptation costs and benefits have been assessed
in a more limited manner for transportation infrastructure (e.g.,
Dore and Burton, 2001). [WGII 17.2.3]

21 Djibouti, Cape Verde, Kenya, Burundi, Rwanda, Malawi, Somalia, Egypt and South Africa.
22 Mauritius, Lesotho, Ethiopia, Zimbabwe, Tanzania, Burkina Faso, Mozambique, Ghana, Togo, Nigeria, Uganda and Madagascar.
23 Only five countries in Africa currently (1990 data) have water access volume less than 1,000 m3/person/yr. These are Rwanda, Burundi,
Kenya, Cape Verde and Djibouti.
5.1.1 Context
Water is one of several current and future critical issues facing
Africa. Water supplies from rivers, lakes and rainfall are
characterised by their unequal natural geographical distribution
and accessibility, and unsustainable water use. Climate change
has the potential to impose additional pressures on water
availability and accessibility. Arnell (2004) described the
implications of the IPCC’s SRES scenarios for a river-runoff
projection for 2050 using the HadCM320 climate model. These
experiments indicate a significant decrease in runoff in the north
and south of Africa, while the runoff in eastern Africa and parts of
semi-arid sub-Saharan Africa is projected to increase. However,
multi-model results (Figures 2.8 and 2.9) show considerable
variation among models, with the decrease in northern Africa
and the increase in eastern Africa emerging as the most robust
responses. There is a wide spread in projections of precipitation
in sub-Saharan Africa, with some models projecting increases
and others decreases. Projected impacts should be viewed in the
context of this substantial uncertainty. [WGI 11.2, Table 11.1;
WGII 9.4.1]
By 2025, water availability in nine countries21, mainly in
eastern and southern Africa, is projected to be less than
1,000 m3/person/yr. Twelve countries22 would be limited to
1,000–1,700 m3/person/yr, and the population at risk of water
stress could be up to 460 million people, mainly in western
Africa (UNEP/GRID-Arendal, 2002).23 These estimates are
based on population growth rates only and do not take into
account the variation in water resources due to climate change.
In addition, one estimate shows the proportion of the African
population at risk of water stress and scarcity increasing from
47% in 2000 to 65% in 2025 (Ashton, 2002). This could
generate conflicts over water, particularly in arid and semiarid
regions. [WGII 9.2, 9.4]
A specific example is the south-western Cape, South Africa,
where one study shows water supply capacity decreasing
either as precipitation decreases or as potential evaporation
increases. This projects a water supply reduction of 0.32%/yr
by 2020, while climate change associated with global warming
is projected to raise water demand by 0.6%/yr in the Cape
Metropolitan Region (New, 2002).
With regard to the Nile Basin, Conway (2005) found that
there is no clear indication of how Nile River flow would be
affected by climate change, because of uncertainty in projected
rainfall patterns in the basin and the influence of complex water
management and water governance structures. [WGII 9.4.2]
Responses to rainfall shifts are already being observed in many
terrestrial water sources that could be considered possible
indicators of future water stress linked to climate variability.
In the eastern parts of the continent, interannual lake level
fluctuations have been observed, with low values in 1993–1997
and higher levels (e.g., of Lakes Tanganyika, Victoria and
Turkana) in 1997–1998, the latter being linked to an excess
in rainfall in late 1997 coupled with large-scale perturbations
in the Indian Ocean (Mercier et al., 2002). Higher water
temperatures have also been reported in lakes in response to
warmer conditions (see Figure 5.1). [WGII 9.2.1.1, 1.3.2.3]

5.1.2 Current observations
5.1.2.1 Climate variability
The Sahel region of West Africa experiences marked multidecadal
variability in rainfall (e.g., Dai et al., 2004a), associated
with changes in atmospheric circulation and related changes
in tropical sea surface temperature patterns in the Pacific,
Indian and Atlantic Basins (e.g., ENSO and the AMO). Very
80
Analysing regional aspects of climate change and water resources Section 5
dry conditions were experienced from the 1970s to the 1990s,
after a wetter period in the 1950s and 1960s. The rainfall deficit
was mainly related to a reduction in the number of significant
rainfall events occurring during the peak monsoon period (July
to September) and during the first rainy season south of about
9°N. The decreasing rainfall and devastating droughts in the
Sahel region during the last three decades of the 20th century
(Figure 5.2) are among the largest climate changes anywhere.
Sahel rainfall reached a minimum after the 1982/83 El Niño
event. [WGI 3.7.4] Modelling studies suggest that Sahel rainfall
has been influenced more by large-scale climate variations
(possibly linked to changes in anthropogenic aerosols), than by
local land-use change. [WGI 9.5.4]
5.1.2.2 Water resources
About 25% of the contemporary African population experiences
water stress, while 69% live under conditions of relative water
abundance (Vörösmarty et al., 2005). However, this relative
abundance does not take into account other factors such as the
extent to which that water is potable and accessible, and the
availability of sanitation. Despite considerable improvements
in access in the 1990s, only about 62% of Africans had access
to improved water supplies in the year 2000 (WHO/UNICEF,
2000). [WGII 9.2.1]
One-third of the people in Africa live in drought-prone areas
and are vulnerable to the impacts of droughts (World Water
Forum, 2000), which have contributed to migration, cultural
separation, population dislocation and the collapse of ancient
cultures. Droughts have mainly affected the Sahel, the Horn
of Africa and southern Africa, particularly since the end of the
1960s, with severe impacts on food security and, ultimately,
the occurrence of famine. In West Africa, a decline in annual
rainfall has been observed since the end of the 1960s, with a
decrease of 20–40% in the period 1968–1990 as compared with
the 30 years between 1931 and 1960 (Nicholson et al., 2000;
Chappell and Agnew, 2004; Dai et al., 2004a). The influence of
the ENSO decadal variations has also been recognised in southwest
Africa, influenced in part by the North Atlantic Oscillation
(NAO) (Nicholson and Selato, 2000). [WGII 9.2.1]
5.1.2.3 Energy
The electricity supply in the majority of African States is derived
from hydro-electric power. There are few available studies that
examine the impacts of climate change on energy use in Africa
(Warren et al., 2006). [WGII 9.4.2] Nevertheless, the continent
is characterised by a high dependency on fuelwood as a major
source of energy in rural areas – representing about 70% of total
energy consumption in the continent. Any impact of climate
change on biomass production would, in turn, impact on the
availability of wood-fuel energy. Access to energy is severely
constrained in sub-Saharan Africa, with an estimated 51% of
urban populations and only 8% of rural populations having
access to electricity. This can be compared with the 99% of
urban populations and 80% of rural populations that have
access in northern Africa. Further challenges from urbanisation,
rising energy demands and volatile oil prices further compound
energy issues in Africa. [WGII 9.2.2.8]
5.1.2.4 Health
Malaria
The spatial distribution, intensity of transmission, and
seasonality of malaria is influenced by climate in sub-Saharan
Africa; socio-economic development has had only limited
impact on curtailing disease distribution (Hay et al., 2002a;
Craig et al., 2004). [WGII 8.2.8.2]
Figure 5.2: Time-series of Sahel (10°N–20°N, 18°W–20°E) regional rainfall (April–October) from 1920 to 2003 derived
from gridding normalised station anomalies and then averaging using area weighting (adapted from Dai et al., 2004a).
Positive values (shaded bars) indicate conditions wetter than the long-term mean and negative values (unfilled bars) indicate
conditions drier than the long-term mean. The smooth black curve shows decadal variations. [WGI Figure 3.37]
81
Section 5 Analysing regional aspects of climate change and water resources
Rainfall can be a limiting factor for mosquito populations and
there is some evidence of reductions in transmission associated
with decadal decreases in rainfall. Evidence of the predictability
of unusually high or low malaria anomalies from both sea
surface temperature (Thomson et al., 2005b) and multi-model
ensemble seasonal climate forecasts in Botswana (Thomson
et al., 2006) supports the practical and routine use of seasonal
forecasts for malaria control in southern Africa (DaSilva et al.,
2004). [WGII 8.2.8.2]
The effects of observed climate change on the geographical
distribution of malaria and its transmission intensity in highland
regions remains controversial. Analyses of time-series data in
some sites in East Africa indicate that malaria incidence has
increased in the apparent absence of climate trends (Hay et al.,
2002a, b; Shanks et al., 2002). The suggested driving forces
behind the resurgence of malaria include drug resistance of
the malaria parasite and a decrease in vector control activities.
However, the validity of this conclusion has been questioned
because it may have resulted from inappropriate use of the
climatic data (Patz, 2002). Analysis of updated temperature data
for these regions has found a significant warming trend since
the end of the 1970s, with the magnitude of the change affecting
transmission potential (Pascual et al., 2006). In southern Africa,
long-term trends for malaria were not significantly associated
with climate, although seasonal changes in case numbers were
significantly associated with a number of climatic variables
(Craig et al., 2004). Drug resistance and HIV infection were
associated with long-term malaria trends in the same area (Craig
et al., 2004). [WGII 8.2.8.2]
A number of further studies have reported associations between
interannual variability in temperature and malaria transmission
in the African highlands. An analysis of de-trended time-series
malaria data in Madagascar indicated that minimum temperature
at the start of the transmission season, corresponding to the
months when the human–vector contact is greatest, accounts for
most of the variability between years (Bouma, 2003). In highland
areas of Kenya, malaria admissions have been associated with
rainfall and unusually high maximum temperatures 3–4 months
previously (Githeko and Ndegwa, 2001). An analysis of malaria
morbidity data for the period from the late 1980s until the early
1990s from 50 sites across Ethiopia found that epidemics were
associated with high minimum temperatures in the preceding
months (Abeku et al., 2003). An analysis of data from seven
highland sites in East Africa reported that short-term climate
variability played a more important role than long-term trends in
initiating malaria epidemics (Zhou et al., 2004, 2005), although
the method used to test this hypothesis has been challenged
(Hay et al., 2005). [WGII 8.2.8.2]
Other water-related diseases
While infectious diseases such as cholera are being eradicated
in other parts of the world, they are re-emerging in Africa. Child
mortality due to diarrhoea in low-income countries, especially
in sub-Saharan Africa, remains high despite improvements in
care and the use of oral rehydration therapy (Kosek et al.,
2003). Children may survive the acute illness but may later
die due to persistent diarrhoea or malnutrition. Several studies
have shown that transmission of enteric pathogens is higher
during the rainy season (Nchito et al., 1998; Kang et al., 2001).
[WGII 8.2.5, 9.2.2.6]
5.1.2.5 Agricultural sector
The agricultural sector is a critical mainstay of local livelihoods
and national GDP in some countries in Africa. Agriculture
contributions to GDP vary across countries, but assessments
suggest an average contribution of 21% (ranging from 10% to
70%) (Mendelsohn et al., 2000b). Even where the contribution
of agriculture to GDP is low, the sector may still support the
livelihoods of very large sections of the population, so that
any reduction in output will have impacts on poverty and food
security. This sector is particularly sensitive to climate, including
periods of climate variability. In many parts of Africa, farmers
and pastoralists also have to contend with other extreme natural
resource challenges and constraints such as poor soil fertility,
pests, crop diseases and a lack of access to inputs and improved
seeds. These challenges are usually aggravated by periods of
prolonged droughts and floods (Mendelsohn et al., 2000a, b;
Stige et al., 2006). [WGII 9.2.1.3]
5.1.2.6 Ecosystems and biodiversity
Ecosystems and their biodiversity contribute significantly
to human well-being in Africa. [WGII Chapter 9] The rich
biodiversity in Africa, which occurs principally outside formally
conserved areas, is under threat from climate variability and
change and other stresses (e.g., Box 5.1). Africa’s social and
economic development is constrained by climate change,
habitat loss, over-harvesting of selected species, the spread of
alien species, and activities such as hunting and deforestation,
which threaten to undermine the integrity of the continent’s
rich but fragile ecosystems (UNEP/GRID-Arendal, 2002).
Approximately half of the sub-humid and semi-arid parts of the
southern African region, for example, are at moderate to high
risk of desertification. In West Africa, the long-term decline in
rainfall from the 1970s to the 1990s has caused a 25–35 km shift
southward in the Sahel, Sudan and Guinean ecological zones in
the second half of the 20th century (Gonzalez, 2001). This has
resulted in the loss of grassland and acacia, loss of flora/fauna,
and shifting sand dunes in the Sahel; effects that are already being
observed (ECF and Potsdam Institute, 2004). [WGII 9.2.1.4]
5.1.3 Projected changes
5.1.3.1 Water resources
Increased populations in Africa are expected to experience
water stress before 2025, i.e., in less than two decades
from the publication of this report, mainly due to increased
water demand. [WGII 9.4.1] Climate change is expected to
exacerbate this condition. In some assessments, the population
at risk of increased water stress in Africa, for the full range
of SRES scenarios, is projected to be 75–250 million and
350–600 million people by the 2020s and 2050s, respectively
(Arnell, 2004). However, the impact of climate change on water
resources across the continent is not uniform. An analysis of
six climate models (Arnell, 2004) shows a likely increase in the
82
Analysing regional aspects of climate change and water resources Section 5
number of people who could experience water stress by 2055
in northern and southern Africa (Figure 5.4). In contrast, more
people in eastern and western Africa will be likely to experience
a reduction rather than an increase in water stress (Arnell,
2006a). [WGII 3.2, Figure 3.2, Figure 3.4, 9.4.1, Figure 9.3]
Groundwater is most commonly the primary source of drinking
water in Africa, particularly in rural areas which rely on low-cost
dug wells and boreholes. Its recharge is projected to decrease
with decreased precipitation and runoff, resulting in increased
water stress in those areas where groundwater supplements
dry season water demands for agriculture and household use.
[WGII 3.4.2, Figure 3.5]
Box 5.1: Environmental changes on Mt. Kilimanjaro. [Adapted from WGII Box 9.1]
There is evidence that climate change is modifying natural mountain ecosystems on Mt. Kilimanjaro. For example, as a
result of dry climatic conditions, the increased frequency and intensity of fires on the slopes of Mt. Kilimanjaro led to a
downward shift of the upper forest line by several hundreds of metres during the 20th century (Figure 5.3, Table 5.1). The
resulting decrease in cloud-forest cover by 150 km2 since 1976 has had a major impact on the capturing of fog as well as
on the temporary storage of rain, and thus on the water balance of the mountain (Hemp, 2005).

A study of the impacts of a 1°C temperature increase in one
watershed in the Maghreb region projects a runoff deficit of
some 10% (Agoumi, 2003), assuming precipitation levels
remain constant. [WGII 9.4.1, 3.2, 3.4.2]
5.1.3.2 Energy
Although not many energy studies have been undertaken for
Africa, a study of hydro-electric power generation conducted
in the Zambezi Basin, taken in conjunction with projections
of future runoff, indicate that hydropower generation would
be negatively affected by climate change, particularly in river
basins that are situated in sub-humid regions (Riebsame et al.,
1995; Salewicz, 1995). [WGII TAR 10.2.11, Table 10.1]
83
Section 5 Analysing regional aspects of climate change and water resources
5.1.3.3 Health
A considerable number of studies have linked climate change
with health issues in the continent. For example, results from
the Mapping Malaria Risk in Africa project (MARA/ARMA)
indicate changes in the distribution of climate-suitable areas for
malaria by 2020, 2050 and 2080 (Thomas et al., 2004). By 2050,
and continuing into 2080, a large part of the western Sahel and
much of southern-central Africa is shown to be likely to become
unsuitable for malaria transmission. Other assessments (e.g.,
Hartmann et al., 2002), using sixteen climate change scenarios,
show that, by 2100, changes in temperature and precipitation
could alter the geographical distribution of malaria in Zimbabwe,
with previously unsuitable areas of dense human population
becoming suitable for transmission. [WGII 9.4.3]
Relatively few assessments of the possible future changes in
animal health arising from climate variability and change
have been undertaken. Changes in disease distribution, range,
prevalence, incidence and seasonality can be expected. However,
there is low certainty about the degree of change. Rift Valley
Fever epidemics, evident during the 1997/98 El Niño event
in East Africa and associated with flooding, could increase in
regions subject to increases in flooding (Section 3.2.1.2). The
number of extremely wet seasons in East Africa is projected
to increase. Finally, heat stress and drought are likely to have
a further negative impact on animal health and the production
of dairy products (this has already been observed in the USA;
see Warren et al., 2006). [WGI Table 11.1, 11.2.3; WGII 9.4.3,
5.4.3.1]
5.1.3.4 Agriculture
Impacts of climate change on growing periods and on
agricultural systems and possible livelihood implications have
been examined (e.g., Thornton et al., 2006). A recent study
based on three scenarios indicates that crop net revenues would
be likely to fall by as much as 90% by 2100, with small-scale
farms being the most affected. However, there is the possibility
that adaptation could reduce these negative effects (Benhin,
2006). [WGII 9.4.4]
A case study of climate change, water availability and agriculture
in Egypt is provided in Box 5.2.
Not all changes in climate and climate variability would,
however, be negative for agriculture. The growing seasons in
certain areas, such as around the Ethiopian highlands, may
lengthen under climate change. A combination of increased
temperatures and rainfall changes may lead to the extension of
the growing season, for example in some of the highland areas
(Thornton et al., 2006). As a result of a reduction in frost in the
highland zones of Mt. Kenya and Mt. Kilimanjaro, for example,
it may be possible to grow more temperate crops, e.g., apples,
pears, barley, wheat, etc. (Parry et al., 2004). [WGII 9.4.4]
Fisheries are another important source of revenue, employment,
and protein. In coastal regions that have major lagoons or lake
systems, changes in freshwater flows, and more intrusion of
saltwaters into the lagoons, would affect species that are the
basis of inland fisheries or aquaculture (Cury and Shannon,
2004). [WGII 9.4.4]
The impact of climate change on livestock in Africa has been
examined (Seo and Mendelsohn, 2006). Decreased precipitation
of 14% would be likely to reduce large farm livestock income by
about 9% (−US$5 billion) due to a reduction in both the stock
numbers and the net revenue per animal owned. [WGII 9.4.4]
Figure 5.4: Number of people (millions) living in watersheds exposed to an increase in water stress, compared to 1961–1990
(Arnell, 2006b). Water-stressed watersheds have runoff less than 1,000 m3/capita/yr, and populations are exposed to an
increase in water stress when runoff reduces significantly, due to climate change. Scenarios are derived from HadCM3
and the red, green and blue lines relate to different population projections; note that projected hydrological changes vary
substantially between different climate models in some regions. The steps in the function occur as more watersheds experience
a significant decrease in runoff. [WGII Figure 9.3]
84
Analysing regional aspects of climate change and water resources Section 5
5.1.3.5 Biodiversity
Soil moisture reduction due to precipitation changes could
affect natural systems in several ways. There are projections
of significant extinctions in both plant and animals species.
Over 5,000 plant species could be impacted by climate change,
mainly due to the loss of suitable habitats. By 2050, the Fynbos
Biome (Ericaceae-dominated ecosystem of South Africa, which
is an IUCN ‘hotspot’) is projected to lose 51–61% of its extent
due to decreased winter precipitation. The succulent Karoo
Biome, which includes 2,800 plant species at increased risk of
extinction, is projected to expand south-eastwards, and about 2%
of the family Proteaceae are projected to become extinct. These
plants are closely associated with birds that have specialised
on feeding on them. Some mammal species, such as the zebra
and nyala, which have been shown to be vulnerable to droughtinduced
changes in food availability, are widely projected to
suffer losses. In some wildlife management areas, such as the
Kruger and Hwange National Parks, wildlife populations are
already dependant on water supplies supplemented by borehole
water (Box 5.3). [WGII 4.4, 9.4.5, Table 9.1]
Many bird species are migrants from Europe and the Palaeo-
Arctic region. Some species use the southern Sahel as a stopover
stage before crossing the Sahara Desert. Drought-induced food
shortage in the region would impair the migration success of
Box 5.2: Climate, water availability and agriculture in Egypt. [WGII Box 9.2]
Egypt is one of the African countries that could be vulnerable to water stress under climate change. The water used in
2000 was estimated at about 70 km3 which is already far in excess of the available resources (Gueye et al., 2005). A
major challenge is to close the rapidly increasing gap between the limited water availability and the escalating demand for
water from various economic sectors. The rate of water utilisation has already reached its maximum for Egypt, and climate
change will exacerbate this vulnerability.
Agriculture consumes about 85% of the annual total water resource and plays a significant role in the Egyptian national
economy, contributing about 20% of GDP. More than 70% of the cultivated area depends on low-efficiency surface
irrigation systems, which cause high water losses, a decline in land productivity, waterlogging and salinity problems (El-
Gindy et al., 2001). Moreover, unsustainable agricultural practices and improper irrigation management affect the quality
of the country’s water resources. Reductions in irrigation water quality have, in their turn, harmful effects on irrigated soils
and crops.
Institutional water bodies in Egypt are working to achieve the following targets by 2017 through the National Improvement
Plan (EPIQ, 2002; ICID, 2005):
• improving water sanitation coverage for urban and rural areas,
• wastewater management,
• optimising the use of water resources by improving irrigation efficiency and agriculture drainage-water reuse.
However, with climate change, an array of serious threats is apparent.
• Sea-level rise could impact on the Nile Delta and on people living in the delta and other coastal areas (Wahab,
2005).
• Temperature rises will be likely to reduce the productivity of major crops and increase their water requirements,
thereby directly decreasing crop water-use efficiency (Abou-Hadid, 2006; Eid et al., 2006).
• There will probably be a general increase in irrigation demand (Attaher et al., 2006).
• There will also be a high degree of uncertainty about the flow of the Nile.
• Based on SRES scenarios, Egypt will be likely to experience an increase in water stress, with a projected decline
in precipitation and a projected population of between 115 and 179 million by 2050. This will increase water stress
in all sectors.
• Ongoing expansion of irrigated areas will reduce the capacity of Egypt to cope with future fluctuations in flow
(Conway, 2005).
Box 5.3: Projected extinctions in the Kruger
National Park, South Africa. [WGII Table 4.1]
In the Kruger National Park, South Africa, and for a
global mean temperature increase 2.5–3.0°C above
1990 levels:
• 24–59% of mammals,
• 28–40% of birds,
• 13–70% of butterflies,
• 18–80% of other invertebrates, and
• 21–45% of reptiles would be committed to
extinction.
In total, 66% of animal species would potentially be lost.

Section 5 Analysing regional aspects of climate change and water resources
such birds. As noted, the precipitation models for the Sahel are
equivocal. [WGII 9.3.1] If the wet scenarios materialise, then the
biodiversity of the sub-Saharan/Sahel region is in no imminent
danger from water-stress-related impacts. On the other hand, the
drier scenario would, on balance, lead to extensive extinctions,
especially as competition between natural systems and human
needs would intensify. [WGII 9.4.5]
Simulation results for raptors in southern Africa, using
precipitation as the key environmental factor, suggest significant
range reductions as their current ranges become drier. [WGII
4.4.3] In all, it is expected that about 25–40% of sub-Saharan
African animal species in conservation areas would be
endangered. [WGII 9.4.5]
5.1.4 Adaptation and vulnerability
Recent studies in Africa highlight the vulnerability of local
groups that depend primarily on natural resources for their
livelihoods, indicating that their resource base – already
severely stressed and degraded by overuse – is expected to
be further impacted by climate change (Leary et al., 2006).
[WGII 17.1]
Climate change and variability have the potential to impose
additonal pressures on water availability, accessibility, supply
and demand in Africa. [WGII 9.4.1] It is estimated that around
25% (200 million) of Africa’s population currently experiences
water stress, with more countries expected to face high future
risk (see Section 5.1.3.1). [WGII 9.ES] Moreover, it has been
envisioned that, even without climate change, several countries,
particularly in northern Africa, would reach the threshold level
of their economically usable land-based water resources before
2025. [WGII 9.4.1] Frequent natural disasters, such as droughts
and floods, have largely constrained agricultural development in
Africa, which is heavily dependent on rainfall, leading to food
insecurity in addition to a range of macro- and microstructural
problems. [WGII 9.5.2]
ENSO has a significant influence on rainfall at interannual
scales in Africa and may influence future climate variability.
[WGI 3.7.4, 3.6.4, 11.2] However, a number of barriers hamper
effective adaptation to variations in ENSO including: spatial
and temporal uncertainties associated with forecasts of regional
climate; the low level of awareness among decision makers
of the local and regional impacts of El Niño; limited national
capacities in climate monitoring and forecasting; and lack of
co-ordination in the formulation of responses (Glantz, 2001).
[WGII 17.2.2]
Regarding the impacts of climate variability and change on
groundwater, little information is available, despite many
countries (especially in northern Africa) being dependent on
such water sources. [WGII 9.2.1]
Previous assessments of water impacts have not adequately
covered the multiple future water uses and future water stress
(e.g., Agoumi, 2003; Conway, 2005), and so more detailed
research on hydrology, drainage and climate change is required.
Future access to water in rural areas, drawn from low-order
surface water streams, also needs to be addressed by countries
sharing river basins (e.g., de Wit and Stankiewicz, 2006).
[WGII 9.4.1]
Adaptive capacity and adaptation related to water resources are
considered very important to the African continent. Historically,
migration in the face of drought and floods has been identified
as one of the adaptation options. Migration has also been found
to present a source of income for those migrants, who are
employed as seasonal labour. Other practices that contribute
to adaptation include traditional and modern water-harvesting
techniques, water conservation and storage, and planting of
drought-resistant and early-maturing crops. The importance of
building on traditional knowledge related to water harvesting
and use has been highlighted as one of the most important
adaptation requirements (Osman-Elasha et al., 2006), indicating
the need for its incorporation into climate change policies to
ensure the development of effective adaptation strategies that
are cost-effective, participatory and sustainable. [WGII 9.5.1,
Table 17.1]
Very little information exists regarding the cost of impacts and
adaptation to climate change for water resources in Africa.
However, an initial assessment in South Africa of adaptation
costs in the Berg River Basin shows that the costs of not adapting
to climate change can be much greater than those that may arise
if flexible and efficient approaches are included in management
options (see Stern, 2007). [WGII 9.5.2]
5.2 Asia
5.2.1 Context
Asia is a region where water distribution is uneven and large
areas are under water stress. Among the forty-three countries of
Asia, twenty have renewable annual per capita water resources
in excess of 3,000 m3, eleven are between 1,000 and 3,000 m3,
and six are below 1,000 m3 (there are no data from the remaining
six countries) (FAO, 2004a, b, c). [WGII Table 10.1] From west
China and Mongolia to west Asia, there are large areas of arid
and semi-arid lands. [WGII 10.2] Even in humid and sub-humid
areas of Asia, water scarcity/stress is one of the constraints for
sustainable development. On the other hand, Asia has a very
high population that is growing at a fast rate, low development
levels and weak coping capacity. Climate change is expected
to exacerbate the water scarcity situation in Asia, together with
multiple socio-economic stresses. [WGII 10.2]
5.2.2 Observed impacts of climate change on water
5.2.2.1 Freshwater resources
Inter-seasonal, interannual, and spatial variability in rainfall
has been observed during the past few decades across all of
Asia. Decreasing trends in annual mean rainfall were observed
in Russia, north-east and north China, the coastal belts and
86
Analysing regional aspects of climate change and water resources Section 5
arid plains of Pakistan, parts of north-east India, Indonesia,
the Philippines and some areas of Japan. Annual mean rainfall
exhibits increasing trends in western China, the Changjiang
(River Yangtze) Basin and the south-eastern coast of China, the
Arabian Peninsula, Bangladesh and along the western coasts
of the Philippines. In South-East Asia, extreme weather events
associated with El Niño have been reported to be more frequent
and intense in the past 20 years (Trenberth and Hoar, 1997;
Aldhous, 2004). It is important to note that substantial interdecadal
variability exists in both the Indian and the east Asian
monsoons. [WGI 3.3.2, 3.7.1; WGII 10.2.2, 10.2.3]
Generally, the frequency of occurrence of more intense rainfall
events in many parts of Asia has increased, causing severe
floods, landslides, and debris and mud flows, while the number
of rainy days and total annual amount of precipitation have
decreased (Zhai et al., 1999; Khan et al., 2000; Shrestha et
al., 2000; Izrael and Anokhin, 2001; Mirza, 2002; Kajiwara
et al., 2003; Lal, 2003; Min et al., 2003; Ruosteenoja et al.,
2003; Zhai and Pan, 2003; Gruza and Rankova, 2004; Zhai,
2004). However, there are reports that the frequency of extreme
rainfall in some countries has exhibited a decreasing tendency
(Manton et al., 2001; Kanai et al., 2004). [WGII 10.2.3]
The increasing frequency and intensity of droughts in many
parts of Asia are attributed largely to rising temperatures,
particularly during the summer and normally drier months,
and during ENSO events (Webster et al. 1998; Duong, 2000;
PAGASA, 2001; Lal, 2002, 2003; Batima, 2003; Gruza and
Rankova, 2004; Natsagdorj et al., 2005). [WGI Box 3.6;
WGII 10.2.3]
Rapid thawing of permafrost and decreasing depth of frozen
soils [WGI 4.7.2], due largely to warming, has threatened
many cities and human settlements, has caused more frequent
landslides and degeneration of some forest ecosystems, and has
resulted in an increase in lake water levels in the permafrost
region of Asia (Osterkamp et al., 2000; Guo et al., 2001; Izrael
and Anokhin, 2001; Jorgenson et al., 2001; Izrael et al., 2002;
Fedorov and Konstantinov, 2003; Gavriliev and Efremov, 2003;
Melnikov and Revson, 2003; Nelson, 2003; Tumerbaatar, 2003;
ACIA, 2005). [WGII 10.2.4.2]
On average, Asian glaciers are melting at a rate that has been
constant since at least the 1960s (Figure 2.6). [WGI 4.5.2]
However, individual glaciers may vary from this pattern, and
some are actually advancing and/or thickening – for example, in
the central Karakorum – probably due to enhanced precipitation
(Hewitt, 2005). [WGI 4.5.3] As a result of the ongoing melting
of glaciers, glacial runoff and the frequency of glacial lake
outbursts, causing mudflows and avalanches, have increased
(Bhadra, 2002; WWF, 2005). [WGII 10.2.4.2]
Figure 5.5 shows the retreat (since 1780) of the Gangotri
Glacier, the source of the Ganges, located in Uttarakhand, India.
Although this retreat has been linked to anthropogenic climate
change, no formal attribution studies have been carried out. It is
worth noting that the tongue of this particular glacier is rather
flat and heavily covered in debris. The shrinkage of tongues
with these characteristics is difficult to relate to a particular
climate signal, since the debris cover delays any signal. Flat
tongues tend to collapse suddenly, with a sudden change in
area, after thinning out for decades with relatively little areal
change. [WGII 10.6.2]
In parts of China, temperature increases and decreases in
precipitation, along with increasing water use, have caused
water shortages that have led to drying up of lakes and rivers.
In India, Pakistan, Nepal and Bangladesh, water shortages
have been attributed to issues such as rapid urbanisation and
industrialisation, population growth and inefficient water use,
which are all aggravated by changing climate and its adverse
impacts on demand, supply and water quality. In the countries
situated in the Brahmaputra–Ganges–Meghna and Indus Basins,
water shortages are also the result of the actions of upstream
riverside-dwellers in storing water. In arid and semi-arid central
and west Asia, changes in climate and its variability continue to
challenge the ability of countries to meet growing demands for
water (Abu-Taleb, 2000; Ragab and Prudhomme, 2002; Bou-
Zeid and El-Fadel, 2002; UNEP/GRID-Arendal, 2002). The
decreased precipitation and increased temperature commonly
associated with ENSO have been reported to increase water
shortages, particularly in parts of Asia where water resources
are already under stress from growing water demands and
inefficient water use (Manton et al., 2001). [WGII 10.2.4.2]

Section 5 Analysing regional aspects of climate change and water resources
5.2.2.2 Agriculture
Production of rice, maize and wheat in the past few decades
has declined in many parts of Asia due to increasing
water stress, arising partly from increasing temperatures,
increasing frequency of El Niño events and reductions in
the number of rainy days (Wijeratne, 1996; Agarwal et al.,
2000; Jin et al., 2001; Fischer et al., 2002a; Tao et al., 2003a,
2004). [WGII 10.2.4.1]
5.2.2.3 Biodiversity
With the gradual reduction in rainfall during the growing season
for grass, aridity in central and west Asia has increased in
recent years, reducing the growth of grasslands and increasing
the bareness of the ground surface (Bou-Zeid and El-Fadel,
2002). Increasing bareness has led to increased reflection of
solar radiation, such that more soil moisture evaporates and the
ground becomes increasingly drier in a feedback process, thus
adding to the acceleration of grassland degradation (Zhang et
al., 2003). [WGII 10.2.4.4]
Precipitation decline and droughts in most delta regions of
Pakistan, Bangladesh, India and China have resulted in drying
of wetlands and severe degradation of ecosystems. The recurrent
droughts from 1999 to 2001, as well as construction of upstream
reservoirs and improper use of groundwater, have led to drying
of the Momoge Wetland located in the Songnen Plain in northeastern
China (Pan et al., 2003). [WGII 10.2.4.4]
5.2.3 Projected impact of climate change on
iiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiwater and key vulnerabilities
5.2.3.1 Freshwater resources
Changes in seasonality and amount of water flow from river
systems are expected, due to climate change. In some parts of
Russia, climate change could significantly alter the variability
of river runoff such that extremely low runoff events might
occur much more frequently in the crop growing regions of the
south-west (Peterson et al., 2002). Surface water availability
from major rivers such as the Euphrates and Tigris might be
affected by alteration of river flow. In Lebanon, the annual net
usable water resource would decrease by 15% in response to a
GCM-estimated average rise in temperature of 1.2°C under a
doubled-CO2 climate, while the flows in rivers would increase
in winter and decrease in spring (Bou-Zeid and El-Fadel, 2002).
The maximum monthly flow of the Mekong is projected to
increase by 35–41% in the basin and by 16–19% in the delta,
with the lower value estimated for the years 2010–2038 and
the higher value for the years 2070–2099, compared with
1961–1990 levels. In contrast, the minimum monthly flows are
estimated to decline by 17–24% in the basin and 26–29% in the
delta (Hoanh et al., 2004) [WGII Box 5.3], suggesting that there
could be increased flooding risks during the wet season and
an increased possibility of water shortages in the dry season.
[WGII 10.4.2.1]
Flooding could increase the habitat of brackish-water fisheries
but could also seriously affect the aquaculture industry and
infrastructure, particularly in heavily populated megadeltas.
Reductions in dry-season flows may reduce recruitment of
some species. In parts of central Asia, regional increases in
temperature are expected to lead to an increased probability of
events such as mudflows and avalanches that could adversely
affect human settlements (Iafiazova, 1997). [WGII 10.4.2.1]
Saltwater intrusion in estuaries due to decreasing river runoff can
be pushed 10–20 km further inland by rising sea levels (Shen et
al., 2003; Yin et al., 2003; Thanh et al., 2004). Increases in water
temperature and eutrophication in the Zhujiang and Changjiang
Estuaries have led to formation of a bottom oxygen-deficient
horizon and increased frequency and intensity of ‘red tides’ (Hu
et al., 2001). Sea-level rises of 0.4–1.0 m can induce saltwater
intrusion 1–3 km further inland in the Zhujiang Estuary (Huang
and Xie, 2000). Increasing frequency and intensity of droughts
in the catchment area would lead to more serious and frequent
saltwater intrusion in the estuary (Xu, 2003; Thanh et al., 2004;
Huang et al., 2005) and thus deteriorate surface water and
groundwater quality. [WGII 10.4.2.1, 10.4.3.2]
Consequences of enhanced snow and glacier melt, as well
as rising snow lines, would be unfavourable for downstream
agriculture in several countries of south and central Asia. The
volume and rate of snowmelt in spring is projected to accelerate
in north-western China and western Mongolia and the thawing
time could advance, which will increase some water sources
and may lead to flood in spring, but significant shortages in
water availability for livestock are projected by the end of this
century (Batima et al., 2004, 2005). [WGII 10.4.2, 10.6]
It is expected that, in the medium term, climate-change-driven
enhanced snow- or glacier melt will lead to floods. Such
floods quite often are caused by rising river water levels due to
blockage of the channel by drifting ice. [WGII 10.4.2, 10.6]
A projected increase in surface air temperature in north-western
China is, by linear extrapolation of observed changes, expected
to result in a 27% decline in glacier area, a 10–15% decline in
frozen soil area, an increase in flood and debris flow, and more
severe water shortages by 2050 compared with 1961–1990
(Qin, 2002). The duration of seasonal snow cover in alpine
areas – namely the Tibet Plateau, Xinjiang and Inner Mongolia
– is expected to shorten, leading to a decline in volume and
resulting in severe spring droughts. Between 20% and 40%
reductions in runoff per capita in Ningxia, Xinjiang and Qinghai
Provinces are likely by the end of the 21st century (Tao et al.,
2005). However, pressure on water resources due to increasing
population and socio-economic development is likely to grow.
Higashi et al. (2006) project that the future flood risk in Tokyo
(Japan) between 2050 and 2300 under the SRES A1B scenario
is likely to be 1.1 to 1.2 times higher than the present condition.
[WGII 10.4.2.3]
The gross per capita water availability in India is projected
to decline from about 1,820 m3/yr in 2001 to as little as
1,140 m3/yr in 2050, as a result of population growth (Gupta
and Deshpande, 2004). Another study indicates that India will
88
Analysing regional aspects of climate change and water resources Section 5
reach a state of water stress before 2025, when the availability
is projected to fall below 1,000 m3 per capita (CWC, 2001).
These changes are due to climatic and demographic factors.
The relative contribution of these factors is not known. The
projected decrease in winter precipitation over the Indian subcontinent
would imply less storage and greater water stress
during the lean monsoon period. Intense rain occurring over
fewer days, which implies increased frequency of floods during
the monsoon, may also result in reduced groundwater recharge
potential. Expansion of areas under severe water stress will
be one of the most pressing environmental problems in South
and South-East Asia in the foreseeable future, as the number
of people living under severe water stress is likely to increase
substantially in absolute terms. It is estimated that, under the
full range of SRES scenarios, from 120 million to 1.2 billion,
and from 185 million to 981 million people will experience
increased water stress by the 2020s and the 2050s, respectively
(Arnell, 2004). The decline in annual flow of the Red River by
13–19% and that of the Mekong River by 16–24% by the end of
the 21st century is projected, and would contribute to increasing
water stress (ADB, 1994). [WGII 10.4.2]
5.2.3.2 Energy
Changes in runoff could have a significant effect on the power
output of hydropower-generating countries such as Tajikistan,
which is the third largest hydro-electricity producer in the world
(World Bank, 2002). [WGII 10.4.2]
5.2.3.3 Agriculture
Agricultural irrigation demand in arid and semi-arid regions of
Asia is estimated to increase by at least 10% for an increase in
temperature of 1°C (Fischer et al., 2002a; Liu, 2002). Based on a
study by Tao et al. (2003b), rain-fed crops in the plains of north
and north-east China could face water-related challenges in future
decades due to increases in water demand and soil-moisture
deficit associated with projected declines in precipitation. Note,
however, that more than two-thirds of the models ensembled in
Figures 2.8 and 2.10 show an increase in precipitation and runoff
for this region. In north China, irrigation from surface water
and groundwater sources is projected to meet only 70% of the
water requirement for agricultural production, due to the effects
of climate change and increasing demand (Liu et al., 2001; Qin,
2002). [WGII 10.4.1] Enhanced variability in hydrological
characteristics will be likely to continue to affect grain supplies
and food security in many nations of Asia. [WGII 10.4.1.2]
5.2.4 Adaptation and vulnerability
There are different current water vulnerabilities in Asian
countries. Some countries which are not currently facing high
risk are expected to face a future risk of water stress, with various
capacities for adaptation. Coastal areas, especially heavily
populated megadelta regions in south, east and south-east Asia,
are expected to be at greatest risk of increased river and coastal
flooding. In southern and eastern Asia, the interaction of climate
change impacts with rapid economic and population growth,
and migration from rural to urban areas, is expected to affect
development. [WGII 10.2.4, 10.4, 10.6]
The vulnerability of a society is influenced by its development
path, physical exposures, the distribution of resources, prior
stresses, and social and government institutions. All societies
have inherent abilities to deal with certain variations in climate,
yet adaptive capacities are unevenly distributed, both across
countries and within societies. The poor and marginalised
have historically been most at risk, and are most vulnerable to
the impacts of climate change. Recent analyses in Asia show
that marginalised, primary-resource-dependent livelihood
groups are particularly vulnerable to climate change impacts
if their natural resource base is severely stressed and degraded
by overuse, or if their governance systems are not capable of
responding effectively (Leary et al., 2006). [WGII 17.1] There
is growing evidence that adaptation is occurring in response
to observed and anticipated climate change. For example,
climate change forms part of the design consideration in
infrastructure projects such as coastal defence in the Maldives
and prevention of glacial lake outburst flooding in Nepal (see
Box 5.4). [WGII 17.2, 17.5, 16.5]
In some parts of Asia, the conversion of cropland to forest
(grassland), restoration and re-establishment of vegetation,
improvement of the tree and herb varieties, and selection and
cultivation of new drought-resistant varieties could be effective
measures to prevent water scarcity due to climate change. Watersaving
schemes for irrigation could be used to avert the water
scarcity in regions already under water stress (Wang, 2003). In
north Asia, recycling and reuse of municipal wastewater (Frolov
et al., 2004) and increasing efficiency of water use for irrigation
and other purposes (Alcamo et al., 2004) will be likely to help
avert water scarcity. [WGII 10.5.2]
There are many adaptation measures that could be applied in
various parts of Asia to minimise the impacts of climate change
on water resources, several of which address the existing
inefficiency in the use of water:
modernisation of existing irrigation schemes and demand
management aimed at optimising physical and economic
efficiency in the use of water resources and recycled water
in water-stressed countries;
public investment policies that improve access to available
water resources, encourage integrated water management
and respect for the environment, and promote better
practices for the sensible use of water in agriculture;
the use of water to meet non-potable water demands. After
treatment, recycled water can also be used to create or
enhance wetlands and riparian habitats. [WGII 10.5.2]
Effective adaptation and adaptive capacity, particularly in
developing Asian countries, will continue to be limited by
various ecological, social and economic, technical, institutional
and political constraints. Water recycling is a sustainable
approach towards adaptation to climate change and can be
cost-effective in the long term. However, the treatment of
wastewater for reuse that is now being practised in Singapore,
and the installation of distribution systems, can initially be
expensive compared to water supply alternatives such as the
use of imported water or groundwater. Nevertheless, they are

Section 5 Analysing regional aspects of climate change and water resources
Box 5.4: Tsho Rolpa Risk Reduction Project in Nepal as observed
anticipatory adaptation. [WGII Box 17.1]
The Tsho Rolpa is a glacial lake located at an altitude of about 4,580 m in Nepal. Glacier shrinkage increased the size of
the Tsho Rolpa from 0.23 km2 in 1957/58 to 1.65 km2 in 1997 (Figure 5.6). The 90–100 million m3 of water contained by
the lake at this time were only held back by a moraine dam – a hazard that required urgent action to reduce the risk of a
catastrophic glacial lake outburst flood (GLOF).
Figure 5.6: Changes in the area of the Tsho Rolpa over time.
If the dam were breached, one-third or more of the water could flood downstream. Among other considerations, this
posed a major risk to the Khimti hydropower plant, which was under construction downstream. These concerns spurred
the Government of Nepal, with the support of international donors, to initiate a project in 1998 to lower the level of the lake
through drainage. An expert group recommended that, to reduce the risk of a GLOF, the lake should be lowered three
metres by cutting a channel in the moraine. A gate was constructed to allow for controlled release of water. Meanwhile,
an early-warning system was established in nineteen villages downstream in case a Tsho Rolpa GLOF should occur
despite these efforts. Local villagers were actively involved in the design of the system, and safety drills are carried out
periodically. In 2002, the four-year construction project was completed at a cost of US$3.2 million. Clearly, reducing GLOF
risks involves substantial costs and is time-consuming, as complete prevention of a GLOF would require further drainage
to lower the lake level.
The case of Tsho Rolpa has to be seen in a broader context. The frequency of glacial lake outburst floods (GLOFs) in
the Himalayas of Nepal, Bhutan and Tibet has increased from 0.38 events/yr in the 1950s to 0.54 events/yr in the 1990s.

potentially important adaptation options in many countries of
Asia. Reduction of water wastage and leakage could be practised
in order to cushion decreases in water supply due to declines in
precipitation and increases in temperature. The use of marketoriented
approaches to reduce wasteful water use could also be
effective in reducing adverse climate change impacts on water
resources. In rivers such as the Mekong, where wet-season
discharge is projected to increase and the dry-season flows
projected to decrease, planned water management interventions
such as dams and reservoirs could marginally decrease wetseason
flows and substantially increase dry-season flows.
[WGII 10.5.2, 10.5.7]
Increases in water demand have placed stress on supply
capacity for irrigation, cities, industry and environmental
flows. Increased demand since the 1980s in New Zealand has
been due to agricultural intensification (Woods and Howard-
Williams, 2004). The irrigated area of New Zealand has
increased by around 55% each decade since the 1960s (Lincoln
Environmental, 2000). From 1985 to 1996, Australian water
demand increased by 65% (NLWRA, 2001). In Australia,
dryland salinity, alteration of river flows, over-allocation
and inefficient use of water resources, land clearing, the
intensification of agriculture and fragmentation of ecosystems
are major sources of environmental stress (SOE, 2001; Cullen,
2002). In the context of projected climate change, water
supply is one of the most vulnerable sectors in Australia
and is expected to be a major issue in parts of New Zealand.
[WGII 11.ES, 11.2.4, 11.7]
5.3.2 Observed changes
The winter-rainfall-dominated region of south-west Western
Australia has experienced a substantial decline in the May–July
rainfall since the mid-20th century. The effects of the decline on
natural runoff have been severe, as evidenced by a 50% drop in
annual inflows to reservoirs supplying the city of Perth (Figure
5.7). Similar pressures have been imposed on local groundwater
resources and wetlands. This has been accompanied by a 20%
increase in domestic usage in 20 years, and a population growth
of 1.7% per year (IOCI, 2002). Although no formal attribution
studies were available at the time of the AR4, climate simulations
indicated that at least some of the observed drying was related
5.3 Australia and New Zealand
5.3.1 Context
Although Australia and New Zealand are very different
hydrologically and geologically, both are already experiencing
water supply impacts from recent climate change, due to
natural variability and to human activity. The strongest regional
driver of natural climate variability is the El Niño–Southern
Oscillation cycle (Section 2.1.7). Since 2002, virtually all of
the eastern states and the south-west region of Australia have
moved into drought. This drought is at least comparable to
the so-called ‘Federation droughts’ of 1895 and 1902, and has
generated considerable debate about climate change and its
impact on water resources, and sustainable water management.

an intense multi-year drought has emerged in eastern and other

5.3.3 Projected changes
5.3.3.1 Water
Ongoing water security problems are very likely to increase
by 2030 in southern and eastern Australia, and parts of eastern
New Zealand that are distant from major rivers. [WGII 11.ES]
The Murray-Darling Basin is Australia’s largest river basin,
accounting for about 70% of irrigated crops and pastures
(MDBC, 2006). For the SRES A1 and B1 emission scenarios
and a wide range of GCMs, annual streamflow in the Basin is
projected to fall 10–25% by 2050 and 16–48% by 2100, with
salinity changes of −8 to +19% and −25 to +72%, respectively
(Beare and Heaney, 2002). [WGII Table 11.5] Runoff in twentynine
Victorian catchments is projected to decline by 0–45%
(Jones and Durack, 2005). For the A2 scenario, projections
indicate a 6–8% decline in annual runoff in most of eastern
Australia, and 14% decline in south-west Australia, in the period
2021–2050 relative to 1961–1990 (Chiew et al., 2003). A risk
assessment for the city of Melbourne using ten climate models
(driven by the SRES B1, A1B and A1F scenarios) indicated
average streamflow declines of 3–11% by 2020 and 7–35% by
2050; however, planned demand-side and supply-side actions
may alleviate water shortages through to 2020 (Howe et al.,
2005). Little is known about future impacts on groundwater in
Australia. [WGII 11.4.1]
In New Zealand, proportionately more runoff is very likely from
South Island rivers in winter, and less in summer (Woods and
Howard-Williams, 2004). This is very likely to provide more
water for hydro-electric generation during the winter peak
demand period, and reduce dependence on hydro-storage lakes
to transfer generation capacity into the next winter. However,
industries dependent on irrigation (e.g., dairy, grain production,
horticulture) are likely to experience negative effects due to
lower water availability in spring and summer, their time of
peak demand. Increased drought frequency is very likely in
eastern areas, with potential losses in agricultural production
from unirrigated land (Mullan et al., 2005). The effects of
climate change on flood and drought frequency are virtually
certain to be modulated by phases of the ENSO and IPO
(McKerchar and Henderson, 2003). The groundwater aquifer
for Auckland City has spare capacity to accommodate recharge
under all the scenarios examined (Namjou et al., 2006). Base
flows in principal streams and springs are very unlikely to
be compromised unless many dry years occur in succession.
[WGII 11.4.1.1]
5.3.3.2 Energy
In Australia and New Zealand, climate change could affect
energy production in regions where climate-induced reductions
in water supplies lead to reductions in feed water for hydropower
turbines and cooling water for thermal power plants. In New
Zealand, increased westerly wind speed is very likely to
enhance wind generation and spillover precipitation into major
South Island hydro-catchments, and to increase winter rain in
the Waikato catchment (Ministry for the Environment, 2004).
Warming is virtually certain to increase melting of snow, the
ratio of rainfall to snowfall, and river flows in winter and early
spring. This is very likely to assist hydro-electric generation at
the time of peak energy demand for heating. [WGII 11.4.10]
5.3.3.3 Health
There are likely to be alterations in the geographical range and
seasonality of some mosquito-borne infectious diseases, e.g.,
Ross River disease, dengue and malaria. Fewer, but heavier,
rainfall events are likely to affect mosquito breeding and increase
the variability in annual rates of Ross River disease, particularly
in temperate and semi-arid areas (Woodruff et al., 2002, 2006).
Dengue is a substantial threat in Australia; the climate of the
far north already supports Aedes aegypti (the major mosquito
vector of the dengue virus), and outbreaks of dengue have
occurred with increasing frequency and magnitude in farnorthern
Australia over the past decade. Malaria is unlikely to
establish unless there is a dramatic deterioration in the public
health response (McMichael et al., 2003). [WGII 11.4.11]
Eutrophication is a major water-quality problem (Davis, 1997;
SOE, 2001). Toxic algal blooms are likely to appear more
frequently and be present for longer due to climate change.
They can pose a threat to human health for both recreation and
consumptive water use, and can kill fish and livestock (Falconer,
1997). Simple, resource-neutral, adaptive management
strategies, such as flushing flows, can substantially reduce their
occurrence and duration in nutrient-rich, thermally stratified
water bodies (Viney et al., 2003). [WGII 11.4.1]
5.3.3.4 Agriculture
Large shifts in the geographical distribution of agriculture
and its services are very likely. Farming of marginal land in
drier regions is likely to become unsustainable due to water
shortages, new biosecurity hazards, environmental degradation
and social disruption. [WGII 11.7] Cropping and other
agricultural industries reliant on irrigation are likely to be
threatened where irrigation water availability is reduced. For
maize in New Zealand, a reduction in growth duration reduces
crop water requirements, providing closer synchronisation of
development with seasonal climatic conditions (Sorensen et al.,
2000). The distribution of viticulture in both countries is likely
to change depending upon suitability compared to high-yield
pasture and silviculture, and upon irrigation water availability
and cost (Hood et al., 2002; Miller and Veltman, 2004; Jenkins,
2006). [WGII 11.4.3]
5.3.3.5 Biodiversity
Impacts on the structure, function and species composition of
many natural ecosystems are likely to be significant by 2020,
and are virtually certain to exacerbate existing stresses such
as invasive species and habitat loss (e.g., for migratory birds),
increase the probability of species extinctions, degrade many
natural systems and cause a reduction in ecosystem services for
92
Analysing regional aspects of climate change and water resources Section 5
water supply. The impact of climate change on water resources
will also interact with other stressors such as invasive species
and habitat fragmentation. Saltwater intrusion as a result of
sea-level rise, decreases in river flows, and increased drought
frequency are very likely to alter species composition of
freshwater habitats, with consequent impacts on estuarine and
coastal fisheries (Bunn and Arthington, 2002; Hall and Burns,
2002; Herron et al., 2002; Schallenberg et al., 2003). [WGII
11.ES, 11.4.2]
5.3.4 Adaptation and vulnerability
Planned adaptation can greatly reduce vulnerability, and
opportunities lie in the inclusion of risks due to climate change
on the demand as well as the supply side (Allen Consulting
Group, 2005). In major cities such as Perth, Brisbane, Sydney,
Melbourne, Adelaide, Canberra and Auckland, concerns about
population pressures, ongoing drought in southern and eastern
Australia, and the impact of climate change are leading water
planners to consider a range of adaptation options. While some
adaptation has already occurred in response to observed climate
change (e.g., ongoing water restrictions, water recycling,
seawater desalination) (see Table 5.2) [WGII Table 11.2, 11.6],
both countries have taken notable steps in building adaptive
capacity by increasing support for research and knowledge,
expanding assessments of the risks of climate change for
decision makers, infusing climate change into policies and
plans, promoting awareness, and dealing more effectively with
climate issues. However, there remain environmental, economic,
informational, social, attitudinal and political barriers to the
implementation of adaptation. [WGII 11.5]
In urban catchments, storm and recycled water could be used
to augment supply, although existing institutional arrangements
and technical systems for water distribution constrain
implementation. Moreover, there is community resistance to
the use of recycled water for human consumption (e.g., in such
cities as Toowoomba in Queensland, and Goulburn in New South
Wales). Installation of rainwater tanks is another adaptation
response and is now actively pursued through incentive policies
and rebates. For rural activities, more flexible arrangements for
allocation are required, via the expansion of water markets,
where trading can increase water-use efficiency (Beare and
Heaney, 2002). Substantial progress is being made in this

Section 5 Analysing regional aspects of climate change and water resources
5.4.1 Context
Europe is well watered, with numerous permanent rivers, many
of which flow outward from the central part of the continent.
It also has large areas with low relief. The main types of
climate in Europe are maritime, transitional, continental, polar
and Mediterranean; the major vegetation types are tundra,
coniferous taiga (boreal forest), deciduous-mixed forest,
steppe and Mediterranean. A relatively large proportion of
Europe is farmed, with about one-third of the area being
classified as arable and cereals being the predominant crop.
[WGII TAR 13.1.2.1]
The sensitivity of Europe to climate change has a distinct north–
south gradient, with many studies indicating that southern
Europe will be the more severely affected (EEA, 2004).
The already hot and semi-arid climate of southern Europe
is expected to become still warmer and drier, threatening its
waterways, hydropower, agricultural production and timber
harvests. In central and eastern Europe, summer precipitation
is projected to decrease, causing higher water stress. Northern
countries are also vulnerable to climate change, although in
the initial stages of warming there may be some benefits in
terms of, for example, increased crop yields and forest growth.
[WGII 12.2.3, SPM]
Key environmental pressures relate to biodiversity, landscape,
soil and land degradation, forest degradation, natural hazards,
water management, and recreational environments. Most
ecosystems in Europe are managed or semi-managed; they are
often fragmented and under stress from pollution and other
human impacts. [WGII TAR 13.1.2.1]
5.4.2 Observed changes
Mean winter precipitation increased over the period 1946–1999
across most of Atlantic- and northern Europe (Klein Tank et al.,
2002) and this has to be interpreted, in part, in the context of
winter NAO changes (Scaife et al., 2005). In the Mediterranean
area, yearly precipitation trends over the period 1950–2000 were
negative in the eastern part (Norrant and Douguédroit, 2006).
An increase in mean precipitation per wet day is observed in
most parts of the continent, even in some areas which are getting
drier (Frich et al., 2002; Klein Tank et al., 2002; Alexander et al.,
2006). As a result of these and other changes in the hydrological
and thermal regimes (cf. Auer et al., 2007), observed impacts
have been documented in other sectors, and some of these are
set out in Table 5.3. [WGI Chapter 3; WGII 12.2.1]
5.4.3 Projected changes
5.4.3.1 Water
Generally, for all scenarios, projected mean annual precipitation
increases in northern Europe and decreases further south.
However, the change in precipitation varies substantially from
season to season and across regions in response to changes in
large-scale circulation and water vapour loading. Räisänen et
al. (2004) project that summer precipitation would decrease
5.4 Europe
regard. Under the National Water Initiative, states, territories
and the Australian Government are now committed to pursuing
best-practice water pricing and institutional arrangements to
achieve consistency in water charging. [WGII 11.5]
When climate change impacts are combined with other
non-climate trends, there are some serious implications for
sustainability in both Australia and New Zealand. In some river
catchments, where increasing urban and rural water demand
has already exceeded sustainable levels of supply, ongoing and
proposed adaptation strategies [WGII 11.2.5] are likely to buy
some time. Continued rates of coastal development are likely
to require tighter planning and regulation if such developments
are to remain sustainable. [WGII 11.7]

Analysing regional aspects of climate change and water resources Section 5
substantially (in some areas up to 70% in the SRES A2 scenario) in
southern and central Europe, and to a smaller degree up to central
Scandinavia. Giorgi et al. (2004) identified enhanced anticyclonic
circulation in summer over the north-eastern Atlantic, which
induces a ridge over western Europe and a trough over eastern
Europe. This blocking structure deflects storms northward,
causing a substantial and widespread decrease of precipitation
(up to 30–45%) over the Mediterranean Basin as well as western
and central Europe. [WGI Table 11.1; WGII 12.3.1.1]
It is projected that climate change will have a range of impacts on
water resources (Table 5.3). Annual runoff increases are projected
in Atlantic- and northern Europe (Werritty, 2001; Andréasson et
al., 2004), and decreases in central, Mediterranean and eastern
Europe (Chang et al., 2002; Etchevers et al., 2002; Menzel and
Bürger, 2002; Iglesias et al., 2005). Annual average runoff is
projected to increase in northern Europe (north of 47°N) by
approximately 5–15% up to the 2020s and by 9–22% up to the
2070s, for the A2 and B2 scenarios and climate scenarios from
two different climate models (Alcamo et al., 2007). Meanwhile,
in southern Europe (south of 47°N), runoff is projected to
decrease by 0–23% up to the 2020s and by 6–36% up to the
2070s (for the same set of assumptions). Groundwater recharge
is likely to be reduced in central and eastern Europe (Eitzinger
et al., 2003), with a larger reduction in valleys (Krüger et al.,
2002) and lowlands, e.g., in the Hungarian steppes: (Somlyódy,
2002). [WGII 12.4.1, Figure 12.1]
Flow seasonality increases, with higher flows in the peak flow
season and either lower flows during the low-flow season or
extended dry periods (Arnell, 2003, 2004). [WGII 3.4.1] Studies
show an increase in winter flows and decrease in summer flows
in the Rhine (Middelkoop and Kwadijk, 2001), Slovakian rivers
(Szolgay et al., 2004), the Volga, and central and eastern Europe
(Oltchev et al., 2002). Initially, glacier retreat is projected to
enhance the summer flow in the rivers of the Alps. However,
when glaciers shrink, summer flow is projected to be reduced
(Hock et al., 2005) by up to 50% (Zierl and Bugmann, 2005).
Summer low flow is projected to decrease by up to 50% in
central Europe (Eckhardt and Ulbrich, 2003), and by up to
80% in some rivers in southern Europe (Santos et al., 2002).
[WGII 12.4.1]
The regions most prone to an increase in drought risk are the
Mediterranean and some parts of central and eastern Europe,
where the highest increase in irrigation water demand is
projected (Döll, 2002; Donevska and Dodeva, 2004). This
calls for developing sustainable land-use planning. Irrigation
requirements are likely to become substantial in countries (e.g.,
in Ireland) where it now hardly exists (Holden et al., 2003).
It is likely that, due to both climate change and increasing
water withdrawals, the area affected by severe water stress
(withdrawal/availability higher than 40%) will increase and
lead to increasing competition for available water resources
(Alcamo et al., 2003b; Schröter et al., 2005). [WGII 12.4.1]
Future risk of floods and droughts (see Table 5.4). Flood risk
is projected to increase throughout the continent. The regions
most prone to a rise in flood frequencies are eastern Europe,
then northern Europe, the Atlantic coast and central Europe,
while projections for southern and south-eastern Europe show
significant increases in drought frequencies. In some regions,
both the risks of floods and droughts are projected to increase
simultaneously. [WGII Table 12.4]
Christensen and Christensen (2003), Giorgi et al. (2004),
Kjellström (2004) and Kundzewicz et al. (2006) all found a
substantial increase in the intensity of daily precipitation events.
This holds even for areas with a decrease in mean precipitation,
such as central Europe and the Mediterranean. The impact of
this change over the Mediterranean region during summer is
not clear due to the strong convective rainfall component and its
great spatial variability (Llasat, 2001). [WGII 12.3.1.2]

Section 5 Analysing regional aspects of climate change and water resources
heatwaves and droughts. Schär et al. (2004) conclude that the
future European summer climate would experience a pronounced
increase in year-to-year variability and thus a higher incidence
of heatwaves and droughts. The Mediterranean and even much
of eastern Europe may experience an increase in dry periods by
the late 21st century (Polemio and Casarano, 2004). According
to Good et al. (2006), the longest yearly dry spell would increase
by as much as 50%, especially over France and central Europe.
However, there is some recent evidence (Lenderink et al., 2007)
that some of these projections for droughts and heatwaves
may be slightly overestimated due to the parameterisation of
soil moisture in regional climate models. Decreased summer
precipitation in southern Europe, accompanied by rising
temperatures, which enhances evaporative demand, would
inevitably lead to reduced summer soil moisture (cf. Douville
et al., 2002) and more frequent and more intense droughts.
[WGII 3.4.3, 12.3.1]
Studies indicate a decrease in peak snowmelt floods by the
2080s in parts of the UK (Kay et al., 2006b), but the impact
of climate change on flood regime can be both positive or
negative, highlighting the uncertainty still remaining in climate
change impacts (Reynard et al., 2004). Palmer and Räisänen
(2002) analysed the modelled differences in winter precipitation
between the control run and an ensemble with transient increase
in CO2 and calculated around the time of CO2 doubling. Over
Europe, a considerable increase in the risk of a very wet winter
was found. The probability of total boreal winter precipitation
exceeding two standard deviations above normal was found to
increase considerably (even five- to seven-fold) over large areas
of Europe, with likely consequences on winter flood hazard.
[WGII 3.4.3]
5.4.3.2 Energy
Hydropower is a key renewable energy source in Europe
(19.8% of the electricity generated). By the 2070s, hydropower
potential for the whole of Europe is expected to decline by 6%,
translated into a 20–50% decrease around the Mediterranean, a
15–30% increase in northern and eastern Europe, and a stable
hydropower pattern for western and central Europe (Lehner
et al., 2005). Biofuel production is largely determined by the
supply of moisture and the length of the growing season (Olesen
and Bindi, 2002). [WGII 12.4.8.1]
5.4.3.3 Health
Climate change is also likely to affect water quality and quantity
in Europe, and hence the risk of contamination of public and
private water supplies (Miettinen et al., 2001; Hunter, 2003;
Elpiner, 2004; Kovats and Tirado, 2006). Both extreme rainfall
and droughts can increase the total microbial loads in freshwater
and have implications for disease outbreaks and water-quality
monitoring (Howe et al., 2002; Kistemann et al., 2002; Opopol
et al. 2003; Knight et al., 2004; Schijven and de Roda Husman,
2005). [WGII 12.4.11]
5.4.3.4 Agriculture
The predicted increase in extreme weather events (e.g., spells of
high temperature and droughts) (Meehl and Tebaldi, 2004; Schär
et al., 2004; Beniston et al., 2007) is projected to increase yield
variability (Jones et al., 2003b) and to reduce average yield (Trnka
et al., 2004). In particular, in the European Mediterranean region,
increases in the frequency of extreme climate events during
specific crop development stages (e.g., heat stress during the
flowering period, rainy days during sowing dates), together with
higher rainfall intensity and longer dry spells, is likely to reduce
the yield of summer crops (e.g., sunflower). [WGII 12.4.7.1]
5.4.3.5 Biodiversity
Many systems, such as the permafrost areas in the Arctic
and ephemeral (short-lived) aquatic ecosystems in the
Mediterranean, are projected to disappear. [WGII 12.4.3]
Loss of permafrost in the Arctic (ACIA, 2004) will be likely
to cause a reduction in some types of wetlands in the current
permafrost zone (Ivanov and Maximov, 2003). A consequence
of warming could be a higher risk of algal blooms and increased
growth of toxic cyanobacteria in lakes (Moss et al., 2003; Straile
et al., 2003; Briers et al., 2004; Eisenreich, 2005). Higher
precipitation and reduced frost may enhance nutrient loss from
cultivated fields and result in higher nutrient loadings (Bouraoui
et al., 2004; Kaste et al., 2004; Eisenreich, 2005), leading to
intensive eutrophication of lakes and wetlands (Jeppesen et al.,
2003). Higher temperatures will also reduce dissolved oxygen
saturation levels and increase the risk of oxygen depletion
(Sand-Jensen and Pedersen, 2005). [WGII 12.4.5]
Higher temperatures are likely to lead to increased species
richness in freshwater ecosystems in northern Europe and
decreases in parts of south-western Europe (Gutiérrez Teira,
2003). [WGII 12.4.6]
5.4.4 Adaptation and vulnerability
Climate change will pose two major water management
challenges in Europe: increasing water stress mainly in southeastern
Europe, and increasing risk of floods throughout most of
the continent. Adaptation options to cope with these challenges
are well documented (IPCC, 2001b). Reservoirs and dykes are
likely to remain the main structural measures to protect against
floods in highland and lowland areas, respectively (Hooijer
et al., 2004). However, other planned adaptation options are
becoming more popular, such as expanded floodplain areas
(Helms et al., 2002), emergency flood reservoirs (Somlyódy,
2002), preserved areas for flood water (Silander et al., 2006),
and flood forecasting and warning systems, especially for flash
floods. Multi-purpose reservoirs serve as an adaptation measure
for both floods and droughts. [WGII 12.5.1]
To adapt to increasing water stress, the most common and
planned strategies remain supply-side measures such as
impounding rivers to form instream reservoirs (Santos et al.,
2002; Iglesias et al., 2005). However, new reservoir construction
is being increasingly constrained in Europe by environmental
regulations (Barreira, 2004) and high investment costs (Schröter
et al., 2005). Other supply-side approaches, such as wastewater
reuse and desalination, are being more widely considered, but
96
Analysing regional aspects of climate change and water resources Section 5
their popularity is dampened, respectively, by health concerns
in using wastewater (Geres, 2004), and the high energy costs of
desalination (Iglesias et al., 2005). Some planned demand-side
strategies are also feasible (AEMA, 2002), such as household,
industrial and agricultural water conservation, reducing leaky
municipal and irrigation water systems (Donevska and Dodeva,
2004; Geres, 2004), and water pricing (Iglesias et al., 2005).
Irrigation water demand may be reduced by introducing crops
that are more suited to a changing climate. An example of a
unique European approach to adapting to water stress is that
regional- and watershed-level strategies to adapt to climate
change are being incorporated into plans for integrated water
management (Kabat et al., 2002; Cosgrove et al., 2004;
Kashyap, 2004), while national strategies are being designed to
fit into existing governance structures (Donevska and Dodeva,
2004). [WGII 12.5.1]
Adaptation procedures and risk management practices for
the water sector are being developed in some countries and
regions (e.g., the Netherlands, the UK and Germany) that
recognise the uncertainty of projected hydrological changes.
[WGII 3.ES, 3.2, 3.6]
and 2002), the Amazon drought (2005), destructive hail
storms in Bolivia (2002) and in Buenos Aires (2006),
Cyclone Catarina in the South Atlantic (2004), and the
record hurricane season of 2005 in the Caribbean region).
The occurrence of climate-related disasters increased by
2.4 times between the periods 1970–1999 and 2000–2005,
continuing the trend observed during the 1990s. Only
19% of the events between 2000 and 2005 have been
economically quantified, representing losses of nearly
US$20 billion (Nagy et al., 2006). [WGII 13.2.2]
Stress on water availability: droughts related to La Niña
created severe restrictions for the water supply and
irrigation demands in central western Argentina and in
central Chile. Droughts related to El Niño reduced the flow
of the Cauca River in Colombia. [WGII 13.2.2]
Increases in precipitation were observed in southern Brazil,
Paraguay, Uruguay, north-east Argentina (Pampas), and
parts of Bolivia, north-west Peru, Ecuador and north-west
Mexico. The higher precipitation provoked a 10% increase
in flood frequency in the Amazon River at Obidos; a 50%
increase in streamflow in the rivers of Uruguay, Parana
and Paraguay; and more floods in the Mamore Basin in
Bolivian Amazonia. An increase in intense rainfall events
and consecutive dry days was also observed over the
region. Conversely, a declining trend in precipitation was
observed in Chile, south-western Argentina, north-eastern
Brazil, southern Peru and western Central America (e.g.,
Nicaragua). [WGII 13.2.4.1]
A sea-level rise rate of 2–3 mm/yr during the last 10–

Glaciers in the tropical Andes of Bolivia, Peru, Ecuador
and Colombia have decreased in area by amounts similar
to global changes since the end of the Little Ice Age (see
Figure 5.9). The smallest glaciers have been affected the
most (see Box 5.5). The reasons for these changes are
not the same as those in mid- and high latitudes, being
related to complex and spatially varying combinations of
higher temperatures and changes in atmospheric moisture
content. [WGI 4.5.3]
Further indications of observed trends in hydrological variables
are given in Table 5.5 and Figure 5.8.
5.5.2.2 Energy
Hydropower is the main electrical energy source for most
countries in Latin America, and is vulnerable to large-scale
and persistent rainfall anomalies due to El Niño and La
Niña, as observed in Argentina, Colombia, Brazil, Chile,
Peru, Uruguay and Venezuela. A combination of increased
energy demand and droughts caused a virtual breakdown of
hydro-electricity in most of Brazil in 2001 and contributed
to a reduction in GDP (Kane, 2002). Glacier retreat is also
affecting hydropower generation, as observed in the cities of
La Paz and Lima. [WGII 13.2.2, 13.2.4]

5.5 Latin America
5.5.1 Context
Population growth continues, with consequences for food
demand. Because the economies of most Latin American
countries depend on agricultural productivity, regional variation
in crop yields is a very relevant issue. Latin America has a large
variety of climate as result of its geographical configuration.
The region also has large arid and semi-arid areas. The climatic
spectrum ranges from cold, icy high elevations to temperate
and tropical climate. Glaciers have generally receded in
the past decades, and some very small glaciers have already
disappeared.
The Amazon, the Parana-Plata and Orinoco together carry into
the Atlantic Ocean more than 30% of the renewable freshwater of
the world. However, these water resources are poorly distributed,
and extensive zones have very limited water availability (Mata
et al., 2001). There are stresses on water availability and quality
where low precipitation or higher temperatures occur. Droughts
that are statistically linked to ENSO events generate rigorous
restrictions on the water resources of many areas in Latin
America.
5.5.2 Observed changes
5.5.2.1 Water
Over the past three decades, Latin America has been subject
to climate-related impacts, some of them linked with ENSO
events.

Colombia and Guyana, while floods engender epidemics in the
dry northern coastal region of Peru (Gagnon et al., 2002). Annual
variations in dengue/dengue haemorrhagic fever in Honduras
and Nicaragua appear to be related to climate-driven fluctuations
in vector densities (temperature, humidity, solar radiation
and rainfall) (Patz et al., 2005). Flooding produced outbreaks
of leptospirosis in Brazil, particularly in densely populated
areas without adequate drainage (Ko et al., 1999; Kupek et al.,
2000). The distribution of schistosomiasis is probably linked to
climatic factors. Concerning diseases transmitted by rodents,
there is good evidence that some increases in occurrence are
observed during/after heavy rainfall and flooding because of
altered patterns of human–pathogen–rodent contact. In some
coastal areas of the Gulf of Mexico, an increase in sea surface
temperature and precipitation has been associated with an
increase in dengue transmission cycles (Hurtado-Díaz et al.,
2006). [WGII 13.2.2, 8.2.8.3]
5.5.2.4 Agriculture
As a result of high rainfall and humidity caused by El Niño,
several fungal diseases in maize, potato, wheat and bean are
observed in Peru. Some positive impacts are reported for the
Argentinean Pampas region, where increases in precipitation
led to increases in crop yields close to 38% in soybean, 18%
in maize, 13% in wheat, and 12% in sunflower. In the same
way, pasture productivity increased by 7% in Argentina and
Uruguay. [WGII 13.2.2, 13.2.4]
5.5.2.5 Biodiversity
There are few studies assessing the effects of climate change on
biodiversity, and in all of them it is difficult to differentiate the
effects caused by climate change from those arising from other
factors. Tropical forests of Latin America, particularly those of
Amazonia, are increasingly susceptible to fire occurrences due
to increased El Niño-related droughts and to land-use change

[WGII 13.2.2]
In relation to biodiversity, populations of toads and frogs
in cloud forests were found to be affected after years of low
precipitation. In Central and South America, links between
higher temperatures and frog extinctions caused by a skin
disease (Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis) were found. One
study considering data from 1977–2001 showed that coral
cover on Caribbean reefs decreased by 17% on average in the
year following a hurricane, with no evidence of recovery for at
least eight post-impact years. [WGII 13.2.2]
5.5.3 Projected changes
5.5.3.1 Water and climate
With medium confidence, the projected mean warming for Latin
America for 2100, according to different climate models, ranges
from 1ºC to 4ºC for the B2 emissions scenario and from 2ºC to
6ºC for the A2 scenario. Most GCM projections indicate larger
(positive or negative) rainfall anomalies for the tropical region
and smaller ones for the extra-tropical part of South America.
In addition, extreme dry seasons are projected to become more
frequent in Central America, for all seasons. Beyond these
results there is relatively little agreement between models on
changes in the frequency of extreme seasons for precipitation.
For daily precipitation extremes, one study based on two
AOGCMs suggests an increase in the number of wet days over
parts of south-eastern South America and central Amazonia,
and weaker daily precipitation extremes over the coast of northeast
Brazil. [WGI Table 11.1, 11.6; WGII 13.ES, 13.3.1]
The number of people living in already water-stressed
watersheds (i.e., having supplies less than 1,000 m3/capita/yr)
in the absence of climate change is estimated at 22.2 million
(in 1995). Under the SRES scenarios, this number is estimated
to increase to between 12 and 81 million in the 2020s and to
between 79 and 178 million in the 2050s (Arnell, 2004). These
estimates do not take into account the number of people moving
out of water stress, which is shown in Table 5.6. The current
vulnerabilities observed in many regions of Latin American
countries will be increased by the joint negative effect of
growing demands due to an increasing population rate for
water supply and irrigation, and the expected drier conditions
in many basins. Therefore, taking into account the number of
people experiencing decreased water stress, there is still a net
increase in the number of people becoming water-stressed.
[WGII 13.4.3]
5.5.3.2 Energy
Expected further glacier retreat is projected to impact the
generation of hydro-electricity in countries such as Colombia
and Peru (UNMSM, 2004). Some small tropical glaciers have
already disappeared, and others are likely to do so within
the next few decades, with potential effects on hydropower
generation (Ramírez et al., 2001). [WGI 4.5.3; WGII 13.2.4]
5.5.3.3 Health
Around 262 million people, representing 31% of the Latin
American population, live in malaria risk areas (i.e., tropical and
sub-tropical regions) (PAHO, 2003). Based on SRES emissions
scenarios and socio-economic scenarios, some projections
indicate decreases in the length of the transmission season of

Section 5 Analysing regional aspects of climate change and water resources
Box 5.5: Changes in South American glaciers. [WGII Box 1.1]
A general glacier shrinkage in the tropical Andes has been observed and, as in other mountain ranges, the smallest
glaciers are more strongly affected [WGI 4.5.3], with many of them having already disappeared during the last century. As
for the largely glacier-covered mountain ranges such as the Cordillera Blanca in Peru and the Cordillera Real in Bolivia,
total glacier area has shrunk by about one-third of the Little Ice Age extent (Figure 5.9).
The Chacaltaya Glacier in Bolivia (16°S) is a typical example of a disintegrating, and most probably disappearing, small
glacier. Its area in 1940 was 0.22 km2, and this has currently (in 2005) reduced to less than 0.01 km2 (Figure 5.10) (Ramírez
et al., 2001; Francou et al., 2003; Berger et al., 2005). Over the period 1992 to 2005, the glacier suffered a loss of 90% of
its surface area, and 97% of its volume of ice (Berger et al., 2005). A linear extrapolation from these observed numbers
indicates that it may disappear completely before 2010 (Coudrain et al., 2005). Although, in the tropics, glacier mass balance
responds sensitively to changes in precipitation and humidity [WGI 4.5.3], the shrinkage of Chacaltaya is consistent with an
ascent of the 0°C isotherm of about 50 m/decade in the tropical Andes since the 1980s (Vuille et al., 2003).
With a mean altitude of 5,260 m above sea level, the glacier was the highest skiing station in the world until a few years
ago. The ongoing shrinkage of the glacier during the 1990s has led to its near disappearance, and as a consequence
Bolivia has lost its only ski resort (Figure 5.10).
Figure 5.10: Areal extent of Chacaltaya Glacier, Bolivia, from 1940 to 2005. By 2005, the glacier had separated into
three distinct small bodies. The position of the ski hut, which did not exist in 1940, is indicated with a red cross. The ski
lift had a length of about 800 m in 1940 and about 600 m in 1996 (shown by a continuous line in 1940 and a broken line
in all other panels) and was normally installed during the precipitation season. After 2004, skiing was no longer possible.

malaria in many areas where reductions in precipitation are
projected, such as the Amazon and Central America. The results
report additional numbers of people at risk in areas around the
southern limit of the disease distribution in South America (van
Lieshout et al., 2004). Nicaragua and Bolivia have predicted a
possible increase in the incidence of malaria in 2010, reporting
seasonal variations (Aparicio, 2000; NC-Nicaragua, 2001).
The increase in malaria and population at risk could affect the
costs of health services, including treatment and social security
payments. [WGII 13.4.5]
Other models project a substantial increase in the number of
people at risk of dengue due to changes in the geographical
limits of transmission in Mexico, Brazil, Peru and Ecuador
(Hales et al., 2002). Some models project changes in the spatial
distribution (dispersion) of the cutaneous leishmaniasis vector
in Peru, Brazil, Paraguay, Uruguay, Argentina and Bolivia
(Aparicio, 2000; Peterson and Shaw, 2003), as well as the
monthly distribution of the dengue vector (Peterson et al.,
2005). [WGII 13.4.5]
5.5.3.4 Agriculture
Several studies using crop simulation models, under climate
change, for commercial crops, were run for the Latin America
region. The number of people at risk of hunger under SRES
emissions scenario A2 is projected to increase by 1 million
in 2020, while it is projected that there will be no change for
2050 and that the number will decrease by 4 million in 2080.
[WGII Table 13.5, 13.4.2]
5.5.3.5 Biodiversity
Through a complex set of alterations comprising a modification
in rainfall and runoff, a replacement of tropical forest by
savannas is expected in eastern Amazonia and the tropical
forests of central and southern Mexico, along with replacement
of semi-arid by arid vegetation in parts of north-east Brazil
and most of central and northern Mexico due to the synergistic
effects of both land-use and climate changes. By the 2050s,
50% of agricultural lands are very likely to be subjected to
desertification and salinisation in some areas. [WGII 13.ES,
13.4.1, 13.4.2]
5.5.4 Adaptation and vulnerability
5.5.4.1 Past and current adaptation
The lack of adequate adaptation strategies to cope with the hazards
and risks of floods and droughts in Latin American countries
is due to low gross national product (GNP), the increasing
population settling in vulnerable areas (prone to flooding,
landslides or drought), and the absence of the appropriate
political, institutional and technological frameworks (Solanes
and Jouravlev, 2006). Nevertheless, some communities and
cities have organised themselves, becoming active in disaster
prevention (Fay et al., 2003b). Many poor inhabitants have been
encouraged to relocate from flood-prone areas to safer places.
With the assistance of IRDB and IDFB loans, they built new
homes, e.g., resettlements in the Paraná River Basin of Argentina,
after the 1992 flood (IRDB, 2000). In some cases, a change in
environmental conditions affecting the typical economy of the
Pampas has led to the introduction of new production activities
through aquaculture, using natural regional fish species such as
pejerrey (Odontesthes bonariensis) (La Nación, 2002). Another
example, in this case related to the adaptive capacity of people
to water stresses, is provided by ‘self-organisation’ programmes
for improving water supply systems in very poor communities.
The organisation Business Partners for Development Water
and Sanitation Clusters has been working on four ‘focus’ plans
in Latin America: Cartagena (Colombia), La Paz and El Alto
(Bolivia), and some underprivileged districts of Gran Buenos
Aires (Argentina) (The Water Page, 2001; Water 21, 2002).
Rainwater cropping and storage systems are important features
of sustainable development in the semi-arid tropics. In particular,
there is a joint project developed in Brazil by the NGO Network
Articulação no Semi-Árido (ASA) Project, called the P1MC
Project, for one million cisterns to be installed by civilian
society in a decentralised manner. The plan is to supply drinking
water to one million rural households in the perennial drought
areas of the Brazilian semi-arid tropics (BSATs). During the
first stage, 12,400 cisterns were built by ASA and the Ministry
of Environment of Brazil and a further 21,000 were planned
by the end of 2004 (Gnadlinger, 2003). In Argentina, national
safe water programmes for local communities in arid regions of
Santiago del Estero Province installed ten rainwater catchments
and storage systems between 2000 and 2002 (Basán Nickisch,
2002). [WGII 13.2.5]
5.5.4.2 Adaptation: practices, options and constraints
Water management policies in Latin America need to be
relevant and should be included as a central point for adaptation
criteria. This will enhance the region’s capability to improve
its management of water availability. Adaptation to drier
conditions in approximately 60% of the Latin America region
will need large investments in water supply systems. Managing
trans-basin diversions has been the solution in many areas (e.g.,
Yacambu Basin in Venezuela, Alto Piura and Mantaro Basin
in Peru). Water conservation practices, water recycling and
optimisation of water consumption have been recommended
during water-stressed periods (COHIFE, 2003) (see Box 5.6).

Section 5 Analysing regional aspects of climate change and water resources
Box 5.6: Adaptation capacity of the South American highlands pre-Colombian communities.
[WGII Box 13.2]
The subsistence of indigenous civilisations in the Americas relied on the resources cropped under the prevailing climate
conditions around their settlements. In the highlands of today’s Latin America, one of the most critical limitations affecting
development was, and currently is, the irregular distribution of water. This situation is the result of the particularities of
atmospheric processes and extremes, the rapid runoff in the deep valleys, and the changing soil conditions. Glacier melt
was, and still is, a reliable source of water during dry seasons. However, the streams run into the valleys within bounded
water courses, bringing water only to certain locations. Since the rainfall seasonality is strong, runoff from glaciers is the
major dependable source of water during the dry season. Consequently, the pre-Colombian communities developed
different adaptive actions to satisfy their requirements. Today, the problem of achieving the necessary balance between
water availability and demand is practically the same, although the scale might be different.
Under such limitations, from today’s Mexico to northern Chile and Argentina, the pre-Colombian civilisations developed
the necessary capacity to adapt to the local environmental conditions. Such capacity involved their ability to solve some
hydraulic problems and foresee climate variations and seasonal rain periods. On the engineering side, their developments
included the use of captured rainwater for cropping, filtration and storage; and the construction of surface and underground
irrigation channels, including devices to measure the quantity of water stored (Figure 5.11) (Treacy, 1994; Wright and
Valencia Zegarra, 2000; Caran and Nelly, 2006). They were also able to interconnect river basins from the Pacific and
Atlantic watersheds, in the Cumbe valley and in Cajamarca (Burger, 1992).
Figure 5.11: Nasca (southern coast of Peru) system of water cropping for underground aqueducts and feeding the phreatic layers.
Other capacities were developed to foresee climatic variations and seasonal rain periods, to organise their sowing
schedules, and to programme their yields (Orlove et al., 2000). These efforts enabled the subsistence of communities
which, at the peak of the Inca civilisation, included some 10 million people in what is today Peru and Ecuador.
Their engineering capacities also enabled the rectification of river courses, as in the case of the Urubamba River, and the
building of bridges, either hanging ones or with pillars cast in the river bed. They also used running water for leisure and
worship purposes, as seen today in the ‘Baño del Inca’ (the spa of the Incas), fed from geothermal sources, and the ruins
of a musical garden at Tampumacchay in the vicinity of Cusco (Cortazar, 1968). The priests of the Chavin culture used
running water flowing within tubes bored into the structure of the temples in order to produce a sound like the roar of a
jaguar; the jaguar being one of their deities (Burger, 1992). Water was also used to cut stone blocks for construction. As
seen in Ollantaytambo, on the way to Machu Picchu, these stones were cut in regular geometric shapes by leaking water
into cleverly made interstices and freezing it during the Altiplano night, at below-zero temperatures. They also acquired
the capacity to forecast climate variations, such as those from El Niño (Canziani and Mata, 2004), enabling the most
convenient and opportune organisation of their foodstuff production. In short, they developed pioneering efforts to adapt
to adverse local conditions and define sustainable development paths.
Today, under the vagaries of weather and climate, exacerbated by the increasing greenhouse effect and the shrinkage
of the glaciers (Carey, 2005; Bradley et al., 2006), it would be extremely useful to revisit and update such adaptation
measures. Education and training of present community members on the knowledge and technical abilities of their
ancestors would be a way forward. ECLAC’s procedures for the management of sustainable development (Dourojeanni,
2000), when considering the need to manage the extreme climate conditions in the highlands, refer back to the pre-
Colombian irrigation strategies.
102
Analysing regional aspects of climate change and water resources Section 5
Problems in education and public health services are
fundamental barriers to adaptation; for example, in the case of
extreme events (e.g., floods or droughts) mainly in poor rural
areas (Villagrán de León et al., 2003). [WGII 13.5]
especially vulnerable, as are those systems that rely upon runoff
from glaciers. [WGII 14.2, 15.2]
In British Columbia, projected impacts include increased
winter precipitation, more severe spring floods on the coast
and the interior, and more summer droughts along the south
coast and southern interior, which would decrease streamflow
in these areas and affect both fish survival and water supplies
in the summer, when demand is the highest. In the Great Lakes,
projected impacts associated with lower water levels are likely
to exacerbate challenges relating to water quality, navigation,
recreation, hydropower generation, water transfers and binational
relationships. [WGII 14.2, 14.4] Many, but not all,
assessments project lower net basin supplies and water levels
for the Great Lakes–St. Lawrence Basin. [WGII 14.ES, 14.2]
5.6 North America
5.6.1 Context and observed change
Climate change will constrain North America’s already overallocated
water resources, thereby increasing competition among
agricultural, municipal industrial, and ecological uses (very high
confidence). Some of the most important societal and ecological
impacts of climate change that are anticipated in this region stem
from changes in surface and groundwater hydrology. Table 5.7
outlines the changes observed in North America during the past
century, which illustrate the wide range of effects of a warming
climate on water resources. [WGII 14.ES]
As the rate of warming accelerates during the coming decades,
changes can be anticipated in the timing, volume, quality
and spatial distribution of freshwater available for human
settlements, agriculture and industrial users in most regions of
North America. While some of the water resource changes listed
above hold true for much of North America, 20th-century trends
suggest a high degree of regional variability in the impacts of
climate change on runoff, streamflow and groundwater recharge.
Variations in wealth and geography also contribute to an uneven
distribution of likely impacts, vulnerabilities, and capacities to
adapt in both Canada and the USA. [WGII 14.ES, 14.1]
5.6.2 Projected change and consequences
5.6.2.1 Freshwater resources
Simulated future annual runoff in North American catchments
varies by region, general circulation model (GCM) and
emissions scenario. Annual mean precipitation is projected
to decrease in the south-western USA but increase over
most of the remainder of North America up to 2100. [WGI
11.5.3.2; WGII 14.3.1] Increases in precipitation in Canada are
projected to be in the range of +20% for the annual mean and
+30% for winter, under the A1B scenario. Some studies project
widespread increases in extreme precipitation [WGI 11.5.3.3;
WGII 14.3.1], but also droughts associated with greater
temporal variability in precipitation. In general, projected
changes in precipitation extremes are larger than changes in
mean precipitation. [WGI 10.3.6.1; WGII 14.3.1]
Warming and changes in the form, timing and amount of
precipitation will be very likely to lead to earlier melting and
significant reductions in snowpack in the western mountains
by the middle of the 21st century. In projections for mountain
snowmelt-dominated watersheds, snowmelt runoff advances,
winter and early spring flows increase (raising flooding
potential), and summer flows decrease substantially. [WGII
14.4] Hence, over-allocated water systems of the western USA
and Canada that rely on capturing snowmelt runoff could be

Section 5 Analysing regional aspects of climate change and water resources
With climate change, availability of groundwater is likely to
be influenced by three key factors: withdrawals (reflecting
development, demand, and availability of other sources),
evapotranspiration (increases with temperature) and recharge
(determined by temperature, timing and amount of precipitation,
and surface water interactions). Simulated annual groundwater
base flows and aquifer levels respond to temperature,
precipitation and pumping – decreasing in scenarios that are
drier or have higher pumping and increasing in scenarios that
are wetter. In some cases there are base flow shifts; increasing
in winter and decreasing in spring and early summer. [WGII
14.4.1] Increased evapotranspiration or groundwater pumping
in semi-arid and arid regions of North America may lead to
salinisation of shallow aquifers. [WGII 3.4] In addition, climate
change is likely to increase the occurrence of saltwater intrusion
into coastal aquifers as sea level rises. [WGII 3.4.2]
5.6.2.2 Energy
Hydropower production is known to be sensitive to total runoff,
to its timing, and to reservoir levels. During the 1990s, for
example, Great Lakes levels fell as a result of a lengthy drought,
and in 1999 hydropower production was down significantly
both at Niagara and Sault St. Marie (CCME, 2003). [WGII
4.2] For a 2–3°C warming in the Columbia River Basin and
British Columbia Hydro service areas, the hydro-electric
supply under worst-case water conditions for winter peak
demand will be likely to increase (high confidence). Similarly,
Colorado River hydropower yields will be likely to decrease
significantly (Christensen et al., 2004), as will Great Lakes
hydropower (Moulton and Cuthbert, 2000; Lofgren et al.,
2002; Mirza, 2004). Lower Great Lake water levels could lead
to large economic losses (Canadian $437–660 million/yr), with
increased water levels leading to small gains (Canadian $28–
42 million/yr) (Buttle et al., 2004; Ouranos, 2004). Northern
Québec hydropower production would be likely to benefit
from greater precipitation and more open water conditions, but
hydro plants in southern Québec would be likely to be affected
by lower water levels. Consequences of changes in seasonal
distribution of flows and in the timing of ice formation are
uncertain (Ouranos, 2004). [WGII 3.5, 14.4.8]
Solar resources could be affected by future changes in
cloudiness, which could slightly increase the potential for
solar energy in North America south of 60°N (based on many
models and the A1B emissions scenario for 2080–2099 versus
1980–1999). [WGI Figure 10.10] Pan et al. (2004), however,
projected the opposite; that increased cloudiness will decrease
the potential output of photovoltaics by 0–20% (based on the
HadCM2 and RegCM224 models with an idealised scenario of
CO2 increase). [WGII 14.4.8] Bioenergy potential is climatesensitive
through direct impacts on crop growth and availability
of irrigation water. Bioenergy crops are projected to compete
successfully for agricultural acreage at a price of US$33/106
g, or about US$1.83/109 joules (Walsh et al., 2003). Warming
and precipitation increases are expected to allow the bioenergy
crop, switchgrass, to compete effectively with traditional crops
in the central USA (based on the RegCM2 model and doubled
CO2 concentration) (Brown et al., 2000). [WGII 14.4.8]
5.6.2.3 Health
Water-borne disease outbreaks from all causes are distinctly
seasonal in North America, clustered in key watersheds, and
associated with heavy precipitation (in the USA: Curriero et al.,
2001) or with extreme precipitation and warmer temperatures
(in Canada: Thomas et al., 2006). Heavy runoff after severe
rainfall can also contaminate recreational waters and increase
the risk of human illness (Schuster et al., 2005) through
higher bacterial counts. This association is often strongest
at beaches close to rivers (Dwight et al., 2002). Water-borne
diseases and degraded water quality are very likely to increase
with more heavy precipitation. Food-borne diseases also
show some relationship with temperature trends. In Alberta,
ambient temperature is strongly, but non-linearly, associated
with the occurrence of enteric pathogens (Fleury et al., 2006).
[WGII 14.ES, 14.2.5]
An increase in intense tropical cyclone activity is likely. [WGI
SPM] Storm surge flooding is already a problem along the Gulf
of Mexico and South Atlantic coasts of North America. The
death toll from Hurricane Katrina in 2005 is estimated at 1,800
[WGII 6.4.2], with some deaths and many cases of diarrhoeal
illness associated with contamination of water supplies (CDC,
2005; Manuel, 2006). [WGII 8.2.2; see also Section 4.5
regarding riverine flooding]
5.6.2.4 Agriculture
Research since the TAR supports the conclusion that moderate
climate change will be likely to increase yields of North American
rain-fed agriculture, but with smaller increases and more spatial
variability than in earlier estimates (high confidence) (Reilly,
2002). Many crops that are currently near climate thresholds,
however, are projected to suffer decreases in yields, quality, or
both, with even modest warming (medium confidence) (Hayhoe
et al., 2004; White et al., 2006). [WGII 14.4.4]
The vulnerability of North American agriculture to climatic
change is multidimensional and is determined by interactions
between pre-existing conditions, indirect stresses stemming
from climate change (e.g., changes in pest competition, water
availability), and the sector’s capacity to cope with multiple,
interacting factors, including economic competition from
other regions as well as improvements in crop cultivars and
farm management (Parson et al., 2003). Water availability is
the major factor limiting agriculture in south-east Arizona, but
farmers in the region perceive that technologies and adaptations
such as crop insurance have recently decreased vulnerability
(Vasquez-Leon et al., 2003). Areas with marginal financial
and resource endowments (e.g., the US northern plains) are
especially vulnerable to climate change (Antle et al., 2004).
Unsustainable land-use practices will tend to increase the

vulnerability of agriculture in the US Great Plains to climate
change (Polsky and Easterling, 2001). [WGII 14.4.4; see also
Section 4.2.2] Heavily utilised groundwater-based systems in
the south-west USA are likely to experience additional stress
from climate change that leads to decreased recharge (high
confidence), thereby impacting agricultural productivity.
[WGII 14.4.1]
Decreases in snow cover and more winter rain on bare soil
are likely to lengthen the erosion season and enhance erosion,
increasing the potential for water quality impacts in agricultural
areas. Soil management practices (e.g., crop residue, no-till) in
the North American grainbelt may not provide sufficient erosion
protection against future intense precipitation and associated
runoff (Hatfield and Pruger, 2004; Nearing et al., 2004).
[WGII 14.4.1]
5.6.2.5 Biodiversity
A wide range of species and biomes could be affected by the
projected changes in rainfall, soil moisture, surface water levels
and streamflow in North America during the coming decades.
The lowering of lake and pond water levels, for example, can lead
to reproductive failure in amphibians and fish, and differential
responses among species can alter aquatic community
composition and nutrient flows. Changes in rainfall patterns
and drought regimes can facilitate other types of ecosystem
disturbances, including fire (Smith et al., 2000) and biological
invasion (Zavaleta and Hulvey, 2004). [WGII 14.4.2] Landward
replacement of grassy freshwater marshes by more salt-tolerant
mangroves, e.g., in the south-eastern Florida Everglades since
the 1940s, has been attributed to the combined effects of sealevel
rise and water management, resulting in lowered water
tables (Ross et al., 2000). [WGII 1.3.3.2] Changes in freshwater
runoff to the coast can alter salinity, turbidity and other aspects
of water quality that determine the productivity and distribution
of plant and animal communities. [WGII 6.4]
At high latitudes, several models simulate increased net
primary productivity of North American ecosystems as a
result of expansion of forests into the tundra, plus longer
growing seasons (Berthelot et al., 2002), depending largely
on whether there is sufficient enhancement of precipitation to
offset increased evapotranspiration in a warmer climate. Forest
growth appears to be slowly accelerating in regions where tree
growth has historically been limited by low temperatures and
short growing seasons. Growth is slowing, however, in areas
subject to drought. Radial growth of white spruce on dry southfacing
slopes in Alaska has decreased over the last 90 years,
due to increased drought stress (Barber et al., 2000). Modelling
experiments by Bachelet et al. (2001) project the areal extent of
drought-limited ecosystems to increase 11% per 1ºC warming
in the continental USA. [WGII 14.4] In North America’s Prairie
Pothole region, models have projected an increase in drought
with a 3°C regional temperature increase and varying changes in
precipitation, leading to large losses of wetlands and to declines
in the populations of waterfowl breeding there (Johnson et al.,
2005). [WGII 4.4.10]
Ecological sustainability of fish and fisheries productivity are
closely tied to water supply and water temperature. It is likely
that cold-water fisheries will be negatively affected by climate
change; warm-water fisheries will generally gain; and the results
for cool-water fisheries will be mixed, with gains in the northern
and losses in the southern portions of their ranges. Salmonids,
which prefer cold, clear water, are likely to experience the
most negative impacts (Gallagher and Wood, 2003). Arctic
freshwater fisheries are likely to be most affected, as they will
experience the greatest warming (Wrona et al., 2005). In Lake
Erie, larval recruitment of river-spawning walleye will depend
on temperature and flow changes, but lake-spawning stocks will
be likely to decline due to the effects of warming and lower lake
levels (Jones et al., 2006). The ranges of warm-water species
will tend to shift northwards or to higher altitudes (Clark et al.,
2001; Mohseni et al., 2003) in response to changes in water
temperature. [WGII 14.4]
5.6.2.6 Case studies of climate change impacts in large
iiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiwatersheds in North America
Boxes 5.7 and 5.8 describe two cases that illustrate the potential
impacts and management challenges posed by climate change
in ‘water-scarce’ and ‘water-rich’ environments in western
North America: the Colorado and the Columbia River Basins,
respectively.
5.6.3 Adaptation
Although North America has considerable capacity to adapt
to the water-related aspects of climate change, actual practice
has not always protected people and property from the adverse
impacts of floods, droughts, storms and other extreme weather
events. Especially vulnerable groups include indigenous peoples
and those who are socially or economically disadvantaged.
Traditions and institutions in North America have encouraged a
decentralised response framework where adaptation tends to be
reactive, unevenly distributed, and focused on coping with rather
than preventing problems. Examples of adaptive behaviour
influenced exclusively or predominantly by projections of
climate change and its effects on water resources are largely
absent from the literature. [WGII 14.5.2] A key prerequisite
for sustainability in North America is ‘mainstreaming’ climate
issues into decision making. [WGII 14.7]
The vulnerability of North America depends on the
effectiveness of adaptation and the distribution of coping
capacity; both of which are currently uneven and have not
always protected vulnerable groups from the adverse impacts
of climate variability and extreme weather events. [WGII 14.7]
The USA and Canada are developed economies with extensive
infrastructure and mature institutions, with important regional
and socio-economic variation (NAST, 2000; Lemmen and
Warren, 2004). These capabilities have led to adaptation and
coping strategies across a wide range of historical conditions,
with both successes and failures. Most studies on adaptive
strategies consider implementation based on past experiences
(Paavola and Adger, 2002). [WGII 14.5]
105
Section 5 Analysing regional aspects of climate change and water resources
Box 5.7: Drought and climatic changes in the Colorado River Basin.
The Colorado River supplies much of the water needs of seven US states, two Mexican states, and thirty-four Native
American tribes (Pulwarty et al., 2005). These represent a population of 25 million inhabitants with a projection of 38 million
by the year 2020. Over the past 100 years the total area affected by severe or extreme climatological drought in the USA
has averaged around 14% each year with this percentage having been as high as 65% in 1934.
The westward expansion of population and economic activities, and concurrent responses to drought events, have resulted
in significant structural adaptations, including hundreds of reservoirs, irrigation projects and groundwater withdrawals,
being developed in semi-arid environments. As widely documented, the allocation of Colorado River water to basin states
occurred during the wettest period in over 400 years (i.e., 1905–1925). Recently, the western USA has experienced
sustained drought, with 30–40% of the region under severe drought since 1999, and with the lowest 5-year period of
Colorado River flow on record occurring from 2000 to 2004. At the same time, the states of the south-west USA are
experiencing some of the most rapid growth in the country, with attendant social, economic and environmental demands
on water resources, accompanied by associated legal conflicts (Pulwarty et al., 2005).
Only a small portion of the full Colorado Basin area (about 15%) supplies most (85%) of its flow. Estimates show that,
with increased climatic warming and evaporation, concurrent runoff decreases would reach 30% during the 21st century
(Milly et al., 2005). Under such conditions, together with projected withdrawals, the requirements of the Colorado River
Compact may only be met 60–75% of the time by 2025 (Christensen et al., 2004). Some studies estimate that, by 2050,
the average moisture conditions in the south-western USA could equal the conditions observed in the 1950s. These
changes could occur as a consequence of increased temperatures (through increased sublimation, evaporation and soil
moisture reduction), even if precipitation levels remain fairly constant. Some researchers argue that these assessments,
because of model choice, may actually underestimate future declines.
Most scenarios of Colorado River flow at Lees Ferry (which separates the upper from the lower basin) indicate that, within
20 years, discharge may be insufficient to meet current consumptive water resource demands. The recent experience
illustrates that ‘critical’ conditions already exist in the basin (Pulwarty et al., 2005). Climate variability and change, together
with increasing development pressures, will result in drought impacts that are beyond the institutional experience in the
region and will exacerbate conflicts among water users.
North American agriculture has been exposed to many severe
weather events during the past decade. More variable weather,
coupled with out-migration from rural areas and economic
stresses, has increased the vulnerability of the agricultural
sector overall, raising concerns about its future capacity to cope
with a more variable climate (Senate of Canada, 2003; Wheaton
et al., 2005). North American agriculture is, however, dynamic.
Adaptation to multiple stresses and opportunities, including
changes in markets and weather, is a normal process for the
sector. Crop and enterprise diversification, as well as soil and
water conservation, are often used to reduce weather-related
risks (Wall and Smit, 2005). [WGII 14.2.4]
Many cities in North America have initiated ‘no regrets’ actions
based on historical experience (MWD, 2005). [WGII Box
14.3] Businesses in Canada and the USA are also investing in
adaptations relevant to changes in water resources, though few
of these appear to be based on future climate change projections.
[WGII 14.5.1] Examples of these types of adaptations include
the following.
• Insurance companies are investing in research to prevent
future hazard damage to insured property, and to adjust
pricing models (Munich Re, 2004; Mills and Lecompte,
2006). [WGII 14.2.4]
• Ski resort operators are investing in lifts to reach higher
altitudes and in equipment to compensate for declining
snow cover (Elsasser et al., 2003; Census Bureau, 2004;
Scott, 2005; Jones and Scott, 2006; Scott and Jones, 2006).
[WGII 14.2.4]
• New York has reduced total water consumption by 27%
and per capita consumption by 34% since the early 1980s
(City of New York, 2005). [WGII 14.2.4]
• In the Los Angeles area, incentive and information
programmes of local water districts encourage water
conservation (MWD, 2005). [WGII Box 14.3]
• With highly detailed information on weather conditions,
farmers are adjusting crop and variety selection, irrigation
strategies and pesticide applications (Smit and Wall, 2003).
[WGII 14.2.4]
• The City of Peterborough, Canada, experienced two 100-
year flood events within 3 years; it responded by flushing
the drainage systems and replacing the trunk sewer systems
to meet more extreme 5-year flood criteria (Hunt, 2005).
[WGII 14.5.1]
• Recent droughts in six major US cities, including New
York and Los Angeles, led to adaptive measures involving
investments in water conservation systems and new water
supply/distribution facilities (Changnon and Changnon,
2000). [WGII 14.5.1]
• To cope with a 15% increase in heavy precipitation,

Analysing regional aspects of climate change and water resources Section 5
Burlington and Ottawa, Ontario, employed both structural
and non-structural measures, including directing
downspouts to lawns in order to encourage infiltration, and
increasing depression and street detention storage (Waters
et al., 2003). [WGII 14.5.1]
• A population increase of over 35% (nearly one million
people) since 1970 has increased water use in Los Angeles
by only 7% (California Regional Assessment Group, 2002),
due largely to conservation practices. [WGII Box 14.3]
• The Regional District of Central Okanagan in British
Columbia produced a water management plan in 2004 for
a planning area known as the Trepanier Landscape Unit,
which explicitly addresses climate scenarios, projected
changes in water supply and demand, and adaptation
options (Cohen et al., 2004; Summit Environmental
Consultants, 2004). [WGII Box 3.1, 20.8.2]
5.7.1 Context
The polar regions are the areas of the globe expected to
experience some of the earliest and most profound climateinduced
changes, largely because of their large cryospheric
components that also dominate their hydrological processes
and water resources. Most concern about the effect of changing
climate on water resources of the polar regions has been
expressed for the Arctic. For the Antarctic, the focus has been
on the mass balance of the major ice sheets and their influence
on sea level, and to a lesser degree, induced changes in some
aquatic systems. The Arctic contains a huge diversity of
water resources, including many of the world’s largest rivers
Box 5.8: Climate change adds challenges to managing the Columbia River Basin.
[WGII Box 14.2]
Current management of water in the Columbia River basin involves balancing complex, often competing, demands for
hydropower, navigation, flood control, irrigation, municipal uses, and maintenance of several populations of threatened
and endangered species (e.g., salmon). Current and projected needs for these uses over-commit existing supplies.
Water management in the basin operates in a complex institutional setting, involving two sovereign nations (Columbia
River Treaty, ratified in 1964), aboriginal populations with defined treaty rights (‘Boldt decision’ in U.S. vs. Washington in
1974), and numerous federal, state, provincial and local government agencies (Miles et al., 2000; Hamlet, 2003). Pollution
(mainly non-point source) is an important issue in many tributaries. The first-in-time first-in-right provisions of western
water law in the U.S. portion of the basin complicate management and reduce water available to junior water users (Gray,
1999; Scott et al., 2004). Complexities extend to different jurisdictional responsibilities when flows are high and when they
are low, or when protected species are in tributaries, the main stem or ocean (Miles et al., 2000; Mote et al., 2003).
With climate change, projected annual Columbia River flow changes relatively little, but seasonal flows shift markedly
toward larger winter and spring flows and smaller summer and autumn flows (Hamlet and Lettenmaier, 1999; Mote et al.,
1999). These changes in flows will be likely to coincide with increased water demand, principally from regional growth
but also induced by climate change. Loss of water availability in summer would exacerbate conflicts, already apparent
in low-flow years, over water (Miles et al. 2000). Climate change is also projected to impact urban water supplies within
the basin. For example, a 2°C warming projected for the 2040s would increase demand for water in Portland, Oregon, by
5.7 million m3/yr with an additional demand of 20.8 million m3/yr due to population growth, while decreasing supply by 4.9
million m3/yr (Mote et al., 2003). Long-lead climate forecasts are increasingly considered in the management of the river
but in a limited way (Hamlet et al., 2002; Lettenmaier and Hamlet, 2003; Gamble et al., 2004; Payne et al., 2004). Each of
43 sub-basins of the system has its own sub-basin management plan for fish and wildlife, none of which comprehensively
addresses reduced summertime flows under climate change (ISRP/ISAB, 2004).
The challenges of managing water in the Columbia River basin are likely to expand with climate change due to changes
in snowpack and seasonal flows (Miles et al., 2000; Parson et al., 2001; Cohen et al., 2003). The ability of managers to
meet operating goals (reliability) is likely to drop substantially under climate change (as projected by the HadCM2 and
ECHAM4/OPYC3 AOGCMs under the IPCC IS92a emissions scenario for the 2020s and 2090s) (Hamlet and Lettenmaier,
1999). Reliability losses are projected to reach 25% by the end of the 21st century (Mote et al., 1999) and interact with
operational rule requirements. For example, ‘fishfirst’ rules would reduce firm power reliability by 10% under the present
climate and by 17% in years during the warm phase of the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO). Adaptive measures have the
potential to moderate the impact of the decrease in April snowpack but could lead to 10 to 20% losses of firm hydropower
and lower than current summer flows for fish (Payne et al., 2004). Integration of climate change adaptation into regional
planning processes is in the early stages of development (Cohen et al., 2006).
5.7 Polar regions
107
Section 5 Analysing regional aspects of climate change and water resources
(Lena, Ob, Mackenzie and Yenisey), megadeltas (Lena and
Mackenzie), large lakes (e.g., Great Bear), extensive glaciers
and ice caps, and expanses of wetlands. Owing to a relatively
small population (4 million: Bogoyavlenskiy and Siggner, 2004)
and severe climate, water-resource-dependent industries such
as agriculture and forestry are quite small-scale, whereas there
are numerous commercial and subsistence fisheries. Although
some nomadic peoples are still significant in some Arctic
countries, populations are becoming increasingly concentrated
in larger communities (two-thirds of the population now live in
settlements with more than 5,000 inhabitants) although most
of these are located near, and dependent on, transportation
on major water routes. Relocation to larger communities has
led to increased access to, for example, treated water supplies
and modern sewage disposal (Hild and Stordhal, 2004). [WGI
10.6.4; WGII 15.2.1]
A significant proportion of the Arctic’s water resources originate
in the headwater basins of the large rivers that carry flow
through the northern regions to the Arctic Ocean. The flows of
these rivers have been the focus of significant hydro-electric
development and remain some of the world’s largest untapped
hydropower potential (e.g., Shiklomanov et al., 2000; Prowse
et al., 2004). Given the role of these rivers in transporting heat,
sediment, nutrients, contaminants and biota into the north,
climate-induced changes at lower latitudes exert a strong effect
on the Arctic. Moreover, it is changes in the combined flow
of all Arctic catchments that have been identified as being so
important to the freshwater budget of the Arctic Ocean, sea-ice
production and, ultimately, potential effects on thermohaline
circulation and global climate. [WGI 10.3.4; WGII 15.4.1]
5.7.2 Observed changes
The most significant observed change to Arctic water resources
has been the increase since the 1930s in the combined flow
from the six largest Eurasian Rivers (approximately 7%:
Peterson et al., 2002). Increased runoff to the Arctic Ocean
from circumpolar glaciers, ice caps and the Greenland ice
sheet has also been noted to have occurred in the late 20th
century and to be comparable to the increase in combined
river inflow from the largest pan-Arctic rivers (Dyurgerov
and Carter, 2004). Changes in mass balance of ice masses is
related to a complex response to changes in precipitation and
temperature, resulting in opposing regional trends such as are
found between the margins and some interior portions of the
Greenland ice sheet (Abdalati and Steffen, 2001; Johannessen
et al., 2005; Walsh et al., 2005). In the case of flow increases
on the Eurasian rivers, potential controlling factors, such
as ice melt from permafrost, forest-fire effects and dam
storage variations, have been eliminated as being responsible
(McClelland et al., 2004), and one modelling study suggests
that anthropogenic climate forcing factors have played a role.
Evaluating the effects of climate and other factors on the
largest Arctic-flowing river in North America, the Mackenzie
River, has proven particularly difficult because of the large
dampening effects on flow created by natural storage-release
effects of major lakes and reservoirs (e.g., Gibson et al., 2006;
Peters et al., 2006). [WGI 9.5.4; WGII 15.4.1.1]
The effects of precipitation on runoff are difficult to ascertain,
largely because of the deficiencies and sparseness of the Arctic
precipitation network, but it is believed to have risen slowly
by approximately 1% per decade (McBean et al., 2005; Walsh
et al., 2005). Changes in the magnitude of winter discharge
on major Arctic rivers have also been observed and linked to
increased warming and winter precipitation in the case of the
Lena River (Yang et al., 2002; Berezovskaya et al., 2005) but,
although also previously thought to be climate-induced, simply
to hydro-electric regulation on the Ob and Yenisei Rivers (Yang
et al., 2004a, b). Changes have also occurred in the timing of
the spring freshet, the dominant flow event on Arctic rivers, but
these have not been spatially consistent over the last 60 years,
with adjacent Siberian rivers showing both advancing (Lena:
Yang et al., 2002) and delaying (Yenisei: Yang et al., 2004b)
trends. Floating freshwater ice also controls the seasonal
dynamics of Arctic rivers and lakes, particularly flooding
regimes, and although there has been no reported change in
ice-induced flood frequency or magnitude, ice-cover duration
has decreased in much of the sub-Arctic (Walsh et al., 2005).
[WGII 15.2.1, 15.4.1.1]
Significant changes to permafrost have occurred in the Arctic in
the last half-century (Walsh et al., 2005) and, given the role of
frozen ground in controlling flow pathways, thawing permafrost
could be influencing seasonal precipitation-runoff responses
(Serreze et al., 2003; Berezovskaya et al., 2005; Zhang et al.,
2005). Permafrost thaw, and the related increase in substrate
permeability, has also been suspected of producing changes
in lake abundance in some regions of Siberia during a threedecade
period at the end of the 20th century (Smith et al., 2005;
see Figure 5.12). At higher latitudes, initial thaw is thought to
have increased surface ponding and lake abundance whereas, at
lower latitudes, lake abundance has declined as more extensive
and deeper thaw has permitted ponded water to drain away to
the sub-surface flow systems. In broader areas of the Arctic, the
biological composition of lake and pond aquatic communities
has been shown to respond to shifts in increasing mean annual
and summer air temperatures and related changes in thermal
stratification/stability and ice-cover duration (Korhola et al.
2002; Ruhland et al., 2003; Pienitz et al., 2004; Smol et al.,
2005; Prowse et al., 2006). [WGI Chapter 4; WGII 15.4.1.1]
Freshwater aquatic ecosystems of the Antarctic have also
been shown to be highly responsive to variations in climate,
particularly to air temperature, although trends in such have
varied across the continent. Productivity of lakes in the Dry
Valleys, for example, has been observed to decline with
decreasing air temperature (e.g., Doran et al., 2002). By contrast,
rising air temperatures on the maritime sub-Antarctic Signy
Island have produced some of the fastest and most amplified
responses in lake temperature yet documented in the Southern
Hemisphere (Quayle et al., 2002). Moreover, warming effects on
snow and ice cover have produced a diverse array of ecosystem
disruptions (Quayle et al., 2003). [WGII 15.2.2.2]
108
Analysing regional aspects of climate change and water resources Section 5
5.7.3 Projected changes
Projecting changes in the hydrology, and thus water resources,
of the Arctic are problematic because of strong variability in
the seasonality and spatial patterns of the precipitation among
GCM models. Although most predict an increase, prediction of
runoff from precipitation inputs is confounded by problems in
apportioning rain and snow as the region warms, or as additional
moisture sources become available with the retreat of sea ice. In
general, however, the latest projections for runoff from the major
Arctic catchments indicate an overall increase in the range of
10–30%. One factor not included in such projections, however,
is the rise in evapotranspiration that will occur as the dominating
terrestrial vegetation shifts from non-transpiring tundra lichens
to various woody species (e.g., Callaghan et al., 2005), although
this might be offset by CO2-induced reductions in transpiration
(e.g., Gedney et al., 2006). Similarly not factored into current
runoff projections are the effects of future permafrost thaw and
deepening of active layers (Anisimov and Belolutskaia, 2004;
Instanes et al., 2005), which will increasingly link surface
and groundwater flow regimes, resulting in major changes in
seasonal hydrographs. Associated wetting or drying of tundra,
coupled with warming and increased active-layer depth, will
determine its source/sink status for carbon and methane fluxes.
Permafrost thaw and rising discharge is also expected to
cause an increase in river sediment loads (Syvitski, 2002) and
potential major transformations to channel networks (Bogaart
and van Balen, 2000; Vandenberghe, 2002). [WGI Chapter 10;
WGII 15.4.2.3, 15.4.1.2]
Runoff in both polar regions will be augmented by the
wastage of glaciers, ice caps and the ice sheets of Greenland
and Antarctica, although some ice caps and the ice sheets
contribute most of their melt water directly to their surrounding
oceans. More important to the terrestrial water resources are
the various glaciers scattered throughout the Arctic, which are
projected to largely retreat with time. While initially increasing
streamflow, a gradual disappearance or a new glacier balance at
smaller extents will eventually result in lower flow conditions,
particularly during the drier late-summer periods, critical periods
for aquatic Arctic biota. [WGI Chapter 10; WGII 15.4.1.3]
Projected warming also implies a continuation of recent trends
toward later freeze-up and earlier break-up of river and lake ice
(Walsh et al., 2005) and reductions in ice thickness, which will
lead to changes in lake thermal structures, quality/quantity of
under-ice habitat, and effects on river-ice jamming and related
flooding (Beltaos et al., 2006; Prowse et al., 2006). The latter is
important as a hazard to many river-based northern settlements
but is also critical to sustaining the ecological health of riparian
ecosystems that rely on the spring inundation of water, sediment
and nutrients (Prowse et al., 2006). [WGII 15.4.1.2, 15.6.2]
The above major alterations to the cold-region hydrology of
the Arctic will alter aquatic biodiversity, productivity, seasonal
habitat availability and geographical distribution of species,
including major fisheries populations (Prowse et al., 2006;
Reist et al. 2006a, b, c; Wrona et al., 2006). Arctic peoples,
functioning in subsistence and commercial economies, obtain
many services from freshwater ecosystems (e.g., harvestable
biota), and changes in the abundance, replenishment, availability
and accessibility of such resources will alter local resource
use and traditional lifestyles (Nuttall et al., 2005; Reist et al.,
2006a). [WGII 15.4.1.3]
Given that the Arctic is projected to be generally ‘wetter’, a
number of hydrological processes will affect the pathways
and increase the loading of pollutants (e.g., persistent organic
pollutants and mercury) to Arctic aquatic systems (MacDonald
et al., 2003). Changes in aquatic trophic structure and food
webs (Wrona et al., 2006) have the further potential to alter
the accumulation of bio-magnifying chemicals. This has special
health concerns for northern residents who rely on traditional
sources of local food. Changes to the seasonal timing and
magnitude of flows and available surface water will also be of
concern for many northern communities that rely on surface
and/or groundwater, often untreated, for drinking water (United
States Environmental Protection Agency, 1997; Martin et al.,
2005). Risks of contamination may also increase with the
northward movement of species and related diseases, and via
sea-water contamination of groundwater reserves resulting
from sea-level rise in coastal communities (Warren et al., 2005).
[WGII 15.4.1]
The large amount of development and infrastructure that tends
to be concentrated near Arctic freshwater systems will be
strongly affected by changes in northern hydrological regimes.
Important examples include the decline of ice-road access to
Figure 5.12: Locations of Siberian lakes that have
disappeared after a three-decade period of rising soil and
air temperatures (changes registered from satellite imagery
from the early 1970s to 1997–2004), overlaid on various
permafrost types. The spatial pattern of lake disappearance
suggests that permafrost thawing has driven the observed
losses. From Smith et al. (2005). Reprinted with permissions

ice hazards to instream drilling platforms and hydro-electric
reservoirs (World Commission on Dams, 2000; Prowse et al,
2004; Instanes et al., 2005). Although the future electricity
production of the entire Arctic has not been assessed, it has
been estimated for an IS92a emissions scenario that the
hydropower potential for plants existing at the end of the 20th
century will increase by 15–30% in Scandinavia and northern
Russia. [WGI 3.5.1; WGII 15.4.1.4]
5.7.4 Adaptation and vulnerability
A large amount of the overall vulnerability of Arctic freshwater
resources to climate change relates to the abrupt changes
associated with solid-to-liquid water-phase changes that will
occur in many of the cryospheric hydrological systems. Arctic
freshwater ecosystems have historically been able to adapt to
large variations in climate, but over protracted periods (e.g.,
Ruhland et al., 2003). The rapid rates of change over the
coming century, however, are projected to exceed the ability
of some biota to adapt (Wrona et al., 2006), and to result in
more negative than positive impacts on freshwater ecosystems
(Wrona et al., 2005). [WGII 15.2.2.2]
From a human-use perspective, potential adaptation measures
are extremely diverse, ranging from measures to facilitate
use of water resources (e.g., changes in ice-road construction
practices, increased open-water transportation, flow regulation
for hydro-electric production, harvesting strategies, and
methods of drinking-water access) to adaptation strategies
to deal with increased/decreased freshwater hazards (e.g.,
protective structures to reduce flood risks or increase flows for
aquatic systems; Prowse and Beltaos, 2002). Strong cultural
and/or social ties to traditional uses of water resources by some
northern peoples, however, could complicate the adoption of
some adaptation strategies (McBean et al., 2005; Nuttall et al.,
2005). [WGII 15.2.2.2]
1. All Small Island States National Communications25
emphasise the urgency for adaptation action and the
financial resources to support such action.
2. Freshwater is seen as a critical issue in all Small Island
States, both in terms of water quality and quantity.
3. Many Small Island States, including all of the
Small Island Developing States (SIDS), see the
need for greater integrated watershed planning and
management.
[WGII TAR Chapter 17]
Water is a multi-sectoral resource that links to all facets of life
and livelihood, including security. Reliability of water supply
is viewed as a critical problem on many islands at present
and one whose urgency will increase in the future. There is
strong evidence that, under most climate change scenarios,
water resources in small islands are likely to be seriously
compromised (very high confidence). Most small islands have
a limited water supply, and water resources in these islands
are especially vulnerable to future changes and distribution of
rainfall. The range of adaptive measures considered, and the
priorities assigned, are closely linked to each country’s key
socio-economic sectors, its key environmental concerns, and
areas most at risk of climate change impacts such as sea-level
rise. [WGII 16.ES, 16.5.2]
5.8.2 Observed climatic trends and projections
iiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiin island regions
Hydrological conditions, water supply and water usage on
small islands pose quite different research and adaptation
problems compared with those in continental situations. These
need to be investigated and modelled over a range of island
types, covering different geology, topography and land cover,
and in light of the most recent climate change scenarios and
projections. [WGII 16.7.1] New observations and re-analyses
of temperatures averaged over land and ocean surfaces since
the TAR show consistent warming trends in all small-island
regions over the 1901 to 2004 period. However, the trends
are not linear and a lack of historical record keeping severely
hinders trend analysis. [WGII 16.2.2.2]
Recent studies show that the annual and seasonal ocean surface
and island air temperatures have increased by 0.6–1.0°C since
1910 throughout a large part of the South Pacific, south-west of
the South Pacific Convergence Zone (SPCZ),26 whereas decadal
increases of 0.3–0.5°C in annual temperatures are only widely
seen since the 1970s, preceded by some cooling after the 1940s,
which is the beginning of the record, to the north-east of the
SPCZ (Salinger, 2001; Folland et al., 2003). For the Caribbean,
Indian Ocean and Mediterranean regions, analyses shows that
warming ranged from 0.24°C to 0.5°C per decade for the 1971 to
2004 period. Some high-latitude regions, including the western
Canadian Arctic Archipelago, have experienced warming at a
5.8 Small islands
5.8.1 Context
The TAR (Chapter 17; IPCC, 2001b) noted that Small Island
States share many similarities (e.g., physical size, proneness
to natural disasters and climate extremes, extreme openness
of economies, low risk-spreading and adaptive capacity) that
enhance their vulnerability and reduce their resilience to climate
variability and change. In spite of differences in emphasis and
sectoral priorities on different islands, three common themes
emerge.
25 Under the UN Framework Convention for Climate Change (UNFCCC), countries are required to provide periodic national communications on
their progress in reducing net GHG emissions, policies and measures enacted, and needs assessments.
26 The SPCZ is part of the ITCZ and is a band of low-level convergence, cloudiness and precipitation extending from the west Pacific warm pool
south-eastwards towards French Polynesia.

more rapid pace than the global mean (McBean et al., 2005).
[WGII 16.2.2.2]
Trends in extreme daily rainfall and temperature across the
South Pacific for the period 1961–2003 show increases in the
annual number of hot days and warm nights, with decreases in
the annual number of cool days and cold nights, particularly
in years after the onset of El Niño, with extreme rainfall
trends generally less spatially coherent than those of extreme
temperature (Manton et al., 2001; Griffiths et al., 2003). In the
Caribbean, the percentage of days with very warm temperature
minima or maxima increased strongly since the 1950s, while the
percentage of days with cold temperatures decreased (Petersen
et al., 2002). [WGII 16.2.2.2]
For the Caribbean, a 1.5–2°C increase in global air temperature is
projected to affect the region through [WGII TAR Chapter 17]:
increases in evaporation losses,
decreased precipitation (continuation of a trend of rainfall
decline observed in some parts of the region),
reduced length of the rainy season – down 7–8% by 2050,
increased length of the dry season – up 6–8% by 2050,
increased frequency of heavy rains – up 20% by 2050,
increased erosion and contamination of coastal areas.
Variations in tropical and extra-tropical cyclones, hurricanes
and typhoons in many small-island regions are dominated by
ENSO and decadal variability. These result in a redistribution
of tropical storms and their tracks such that increases in one
basin are often compensated by decreases in other basins. For
example, during an El Niño event, the incidence of hurricanes
typically decreases in the Atlantic and far-western Pacific and
Australasian regions, while it increases in the central, north
and south Pacific, and especially in the western North Pacific
typhoon region. There is observational evidence for an increase
in intense tropical cyclone activity in the North Atlantic since
about 1970, correlated with increases in tropical SSTs. There
are also suggestions of increases in intense tropical cyclone
activity in other regions where concerns over data quality are
greater. Multi-decadal variability and the quality of records
prior to about 1970 complicate the detection of long-term
trends. Estimates of the potential destructiveness of tropical
cyclones suggest a substantial upward trend since the mid-
1970s. [WGI TS, 3.8.3; WGII 16.2.2.2]
Analyses of sea-level records having at least 25 years of hourly
data from stations installed around the Pacific Basin show
an overall average mean relative sea-level rise of 0.7 mm/yr
(Mitchell et al., 2001). Focusing only on the island stations with
more than 50 years of data (only four locations), the average
rate of sea-level rise (relative to the Earth’s crust) is 1.6 mm/yr.
[WGI 5.5.2]
5.8.2.1 Water
Table 5.8, based on seven GCMs and for a range of SRES
emissions scenarios, compares projected precipitation changes
over small islands by region. In the Caribbean, many islands
are expected to experience increased water stress as a result of
••
••••
climate change, with all SRES scenarios projecting reduced
rainfall in summer across the region. It is unlikely that demand
would be met during low rainfall periods. Increased rainfall
in the Northern Hemisphere winter is unlikely to compensate,
due to a combination of lack of storage and high runoff during
storms. [WGII 16.3.1]

[WGII Table 16.2]
In the Pacific, a 10% reduction in average rainfall (by 2050)
would lead to a 20% reduction in the size of the freshwater lens
on Tarawa Atoll, Kiribati. Reduced rainfall coupled with sealevel
rise would compound the risks to water supply reliability.
[WGII 16.4.1]
Many small islands have begun to invest in the implementation
of adaptation strategies, including desalination, to offset
current and projected water shortages. However, the impacts
of desalination plants themselves on environmental amenities
and the need to fully address environmental water requirements
have not been fully considered. [WGII 16.4.1]
Given the high visibility and impacts of hurricanes, droughts
have received less attention by researchers and planners,
although these may lead to increased withdrawals and potential
for saltwater intrusion into near-shore aquifers. In the Bahamas,
for instance, freshwater lenses are the only exploitable
groundwater resources. These lenses are affected periodically
by saline intrusions caused by over-pumping and excess
evapotranspiration. Groundwater in most cases is slow-moving
and, as a result, serious reductions in groundwater reserves
are slow to recover and may not be reversible; variability in
annual volumes of available water is generally not as extreme
as for surface water resources; and water quality degradation
and pollution have long-term effects and cannot quickly be
remedied. [WGII 16.4.1]
Some Island States such as Malta (MRAE, 2004) emphasise
potential economic sectors that will require adaptation,
including power generation, transport and waste management;
whereas agriculture and human health figure prominently in
communications from the Comoros (GDE, 2002), Vanuatu
(Republic of Vanuatu, 1999) and St. Vincent and the Grenadines
(NEAB, 2000). In these cases, sea-level rise is not seen as the
most critical issue, although it is in the low-lying atoll states
such as Kiribati, Tuvalu, Marshall Islands and the Maldives.
[WGII 16.4.2]
111
Section 5 Analysing regional aspects of climate change and water resources
5.8.2.2 Energy
Access to reliable and affordable energy is a vital element in
most small islands, where the high cost of energy is regarded
as a barrier to the goal of attaining sustainable development.
Some islands, such as Dominica in the Caribbean, rely on
hydropower for a significant part of their energy supply.
Research and development into energy efficiency and options
appropriate to small islands, such as solar and wind, could
help in both adaptation and mitigation strategies, while
enhancing the prospect of achieving sustainable growth.
[WGII 16.4.6, 16.4.7]
5.8.2.3 Health
Many small islands lie in tropical or sub-tropical zones with
weather conducive to the transmission of diseases such as
malaria, dengue, filariasis, schistosomiasis and food- and
water-borne diseases. The rates of occurrence of many of
these diseases are increasing in small islands for a number of
reasons, including poor public health practices, inadequate
infrastructure, poor waste-management practices, increasing
global travel, and changing climatic conditions (WHO, 2003).
In the Caribbean, the incidence of dengue fever increases during
warm years of ENSO cycles (Rawlins et al., 2005). Because
the greatest risk of dengue transmission is during annual wet
seasons, vector control programmes should target these periods
in order to reduce disease burdens. The incidence of diarrhoeal
diseases is associated with annual average temperature (Singh
et al., 2001) [WGII 8.2, 8.4], and negatively associated with
water availability in the Pacific (Singh et al., 2001). Therefore,
increasing temperatures and decreasing water availability due
to climate change may increase burdens of diarrhoeal and other
infectious diseases in some Small Island States. [WGII 16.4.5]
5.8.2.4 Agriculture
Projected impacts of climate change include extended periods
of drought and, on the other hand, loss of soil fertility and
degradation as a result of increased precipitation, both of which
will negatively impact on agriculture and food security. In its
study on the economic and social implications of climate change
and variability for selected Pacific islands, the World Bank
(2000) found that, in the absence of adaptation, a high island
such as Viti Levu, Fiji, could experience damages of US$23–
52 million per year by 2050, (equivalent to 2–3% of Fiji’s GDP
in 2002), while a group of low islands such as Tarawa, Kiribati,
could face damages of more than US$8–16 million a year
(equivalent to 17–18% of Kiribati’s GDP in 2002) under SRES
A2 and B2. On many Caribbean islands, reliance on agricultural
imports, which themselves include water used for production in
the countries of origin, constitute up to 50% of food supply.
[WGII 16.4.3]
5.8.2.5 Biodiversity
Burke et al. (2002) and Burke and Maidens (2004) indicate
that about 50% of the reefs in south-east Asia and 45% in the
Caribbean are classed in the high to very high risk category (see
also Graham et al, 2006). There are, however, significant local and
regional differences in the scale and type of threats to coral reefs
in both continental and small island situations. [WGII 16.4.4]
Both the terrestrial ecosystems of larger islands and coastal
ecosystems of most islands have been subjected to increasing
degradation and destruction in recent decades. For instance,
analysis of coral reef surveys over three decades has revealed that
coral cover across reefs in the Caribbean has declined by 80%
in just 30 years, largely as a result of pollution, sedimentation,
marine diseases and over-fishing (Gardner et al., 2003). Runoff
from land areas, together with direct input of freshwater through
heavy rain events, can have significant impacts on reef quality
and susceptibility to disease. [WGII 16.4.4]
5.8.3 Adaptation, vulnerability and sustainability
Sustainable development is often stated as an objective of
management strategies for small islands. Relatively little
work has explicitly considered what sustainable development
means for islands in the context of climate change (Kerr,
2005). It has long been known that the problems of small scale
and isolation, of specialised economies, and of the opposing
forces of globalisation and localisation, may mean that current
development in small islands becomes unsustainable in the long
term. [WGII 16.6]
Danger is associated with the narrowing of adaptation options
to expected impacts of climate change, under the uncertainty
of potential climate-driven physical impacts. Table 5.9
summarises the results of several scenario-based impact studies
for island environments from the present through to 2100, i.e.,
some impacts are already occurring. It provides the context for
other potential climate impacts that might exacerbate waterrelated
stresses. Thresholds may originate from social as well
as environmental processes. Furthermore, the challenge is to
understand the adaptation strategies that have been adopted in
the past and the benefits and limits of these for future planning
and implementation. [WGII 16.5]
While there has been considerable progress in regional
projections of sea level since the TAR, such projections have
not been fully utilised in small islands because of the greater
uncertainty attached to their local manifestations, as opposed
to global projections. Reliable and credible projections based
on outputs at finer resolution, together with local data, are
needed to inform the development of reliable climate change
scenarios for small islands. These approaches could lead to
improved vulnerability assessments and the identification of
more appropriate adaptation options at the scale of islands and
across time-scales of climatic impacts. [WGII 16.7.1]
Vulnerability studies conducted for selected small islands
(Nurse et al., 2001) show that the costs of infrastructure and
settlement protection represent a significant proportion of
GDP, often well beyond the financial means of most Small
Island States; a problem not always shared by the islands of
continental countries. More recent studies have identified major
areas of adaptation, including water resources and watershed
management, reef conservation, agricultural and forest
management, conservation of biodiversity, energy security,
increased development of renewable energy and optimised

energy consumption. A framework which considers current and
future community vulnerability and involves methodologies
integrating climate science, social science and communication,
provides the basis for building adaptive capacity. [WGII Box
16.7] This approach requires community members to identify
climate conditions relevant to them, and to assess present and
potential adaptive strategies. One such methodology was tested in
Samoa, and results from one village (Saoluafata: see Sutherland
et al., 2005). In this case, local residents identified several
adaptive measures including building a seawall, a water-drainage
system, water tanks, a ban on tree clearing, some relocation, and
renovation to existing infrastructure. [WGII 16.5]
The IPCC AR4 has identified several key areas and gaps that are
under-represented in contemporary research on the impacts of
climate change on small islands. [WGII 16.7] These include:
• the role of coastal ecosystems such as mangroves, coral
reefs and beaches in providing natural defences against
sea-level rise and storms;
• establishing the response of terrestrial upland and inland
ecosystems to changes in mean temperature and rainfall
and in temperature and rainfall extremes;
• considering how commercial agriculture, forestry and
fisheries, as well as subsistence agriculture, artisanal fishing
and food security, will be impacted by the combination of
climate change and non-climate-related forces;
• expanding knowledge of climate-sensitive diseases in
small islands through national and regional research – not
only for vector-borne diseases but for skin, respiratory and
water-borne diseases;
• given the diversity of ‘island types’ and locations,
identifying the most vulnerable systems and sectors,
according to island types.
In contrast to the other regions in this assessment, there is
also an absence of reliable demographic and socio-economic
scenarios and projections for small islands. The result is that
future changes in socio-economic conditions on small islands
have not been well presented in the existing assessments. For
example, without either adaptation or mitigation, the impacts
of sea-level rise, more intense storms and other climate
change [WGII 6.3.2] will be substantial, suggesting that some
islands and low-lying areas may become unliveable by 2100.

Climate change mitigation measures
and water

Section 6 Climate change mitigation measures and water
6.1 Introduction
The relationship between climate change mitigation measures
and water is a reciprocal one. Mitigation measures can influence
water resources and their management, and it is important to
realise this when developing and evaluating mitigation options.
On the other hand, water management policies and measures
can have an influence on greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions
and, thus, on the respective sectoral mitigation measures;
interventions in the water system might be counter-productive
when evaluated in terms of climate change mitigation.
The issue of mitigation is addressed in the IPCC WGIII AR4
(Mitigation), where the following seven sectors were discussed:
energy supply, transportation and its infrastructure, residential
and commercial buildings, industry, agriculture, forestry, and
waste management. Since water issues were not the focus of
that volume, only general interrelations with climate change
mitigation were mentioned, most of them being qualitative.
However, other IPCC reports, such as the TAR, also contain
information on this issue.
Sector-specific mitigation measures can have various effects on
water, which are explained in the sections below (see also Table
6.1). Numbers in parentheses in the titles of the sub-sections
correspond to the practices or sector-specific mitigation options
described in Table 6.1.
programme, and implementation of remediation methods to
stop or control CO2 releases. [CCS 5.ES, 5.2].
6.2.2 Bio-energy crops (2)
Bio-energy produces mitigation benefits by displacing fossilfuel
use. [LULUCF 4.5.1] However, large-scale bio-fuel
production raises questions on several issues including fertiliser
and pesticide requirements, nutrient cycling, energy balances,
biodiversity impacts, hydrology and erosion, conflicts with
food production, and the level of financial subsidies required.
[LULUCF 4.5.1] The energy production and GHG mitigation
potentials of dedicated energy crops depends on the availability
of land, which must also meet demands for food as well as for
nature protection, sustainable management of soils and water
reserves, and other sustainability criteria. Various studies
have arrived at differing figures for the potential contribution
of biomass to future global energy supplies, ranging from
below 100 EJ/yr to above 400 EJ/yr in 2050 (Hoogwijk, 2004;
Hoogwijk et al., 2005; Sims et al., 2006). Smeets et al. (2007)
indicate that the ultimate technical potential for energy cropping
on current agricultural land, with projected technological
progress in agriculture and livestock, could deliver over 800 EJ/
yr without jeopardising the world’s food supply. Differences
between studies are largely attributable to uncertainty in land
availability, energy crop yields, and assumptions about changes
in agricultural efficiency. Those with the largest projected
potential assume that not only degraded/surplus lands are used,
but also land currently used for food production, including
pasture land (as did Smeets et al., 2007). [WGIII 8.4.4.2]
Agricultural practices for mitigation of GHGs could, in some
cases, intensify water use, thereby reducing streamflow or
groundwater reserves (Unkovich, 2003; Dias de Oliveira et al.,
2005). For instance, high-productivity, evergreen, deep-rooted
bio-energy plantations generally have a higher water use than the
land cover they replace (Berndes and Börjesson, 2002; Jackson
et al., 2005). Some practices may affect water quality through
enhanced leaching of pesticides and nutrients (Machado and
Silva, 2001; Freibauer et al., 2004). [WGIII 8.8]
Agricultural mitigation practices that divert products to
alternative uses (e.g., bio-energy crops) may induce the
conversion of forests to cropland elsewhere. Conversely,
increasing productivity on existing croplands may ‘spare’ some
forest or grasslands (West and Marland, 2003; Balmford et al.,
2005; Mooney et al., 2005). The net effect of such trade-offs on
biodiversity and other ecosystem services has not yet been fully
quantified (Huston and Marland, 2003; Green et al., 2005).
[WGIII 8.8]
If bio-energy plantations are appropriately located, designed
and managed, they may reduce nutrient leaching and soil
erosion and generate additional environmental services such
as soil carbon accumulation, improved soil fertility, and the
removal of cadmium and other heavy metals from soils or
wastes. They may also increase nutrient recirculation, aid in the

6.2.1 Carbon dioxide capture and storage (CCS)
iiiiiiiiiiiiiiii(refer to (1) in Table 6.1)
Carbon dioxide (CO2) capture and storage (CCS) is a process
consisting of the separation of CO2 from industrial and energyrelated
sources, transport to a storage location and long-term
isolation from the atmosphere. The injection of CO2 into the
pore space and fractures of a permeable formation can displace
in situ fluid, or the CO2 may dissolve in or mix with the
fluid or react with the mineral grains, or there may be some
combination of these processes. As CO2 migrates through the
formation, some of it will dissolve into the formation water.
Once CO2 is dissolved in the formation fluid, it is transported
by the regional groundwater flow. Leakage of CO2 from leaking
injection wells, abandoned wells, and leakage across faults
and ineffective confining layers could potentially degrade the
quality of groundwater; and the release of CO2 back into the
atmosphere could also create local health and safety concerns.
[CCS SPM, 5.ES]
It is important to note that, at this point, there is no complete
insight into the practicality, consequences or unintended
consequences of this carbon sequestration concept. Avoiding
or mitigating the impacts will require careful site selection,
effective regulatory oversight, an appropriate monitoring

Table 6.1: Influence of sector-specific mitigation options (or their consequences) on water quality, quantity and level. Positive
effects on water are indicated with [+]; negative effects with [−]; and uncertain effects with [?]. Numbers in round brackets
refer to the Notes, and also to the sub-section numbers in Section 6.2.
Notes:
(1) Carbon capture and storage (CCS) underground poses potential risks to groundwater quality; deep-sea storage (below 3,000 m water depth and a few hundred metres
of sediment) seems to be the safest option.
(2) Expanding bio-energy crops and forests may cause negative impacts such as increased water demand, contamination of underground water and promotion of landuse
changes, leading to indirect effects on water resources; and/or positive impacts through reduced nutrient leaching, soil erosion, runoff and downstream siltation.
(3) Biomass electricity: in general, a higher contribution of renewable energy (as compared to fossil-fuel power plants) means a reduction of the discharge of cooling
iiiiiiiiiwater to the surface water.
(4) Environmental impact and multiple benefits of hydropower need to be taken into account for any given development; they could be either positive or negative.
(5) Geothermal energy use might result in pollution, subsidence and, in some cases, a claim on available water resources.
(6) Energy use in the building sector can be reduced by different approaches and measures, with positive and negative impacts.
(7) Land-use change and management can influence surface water and groundwater quality (e.g., through enhanced or reduced leaching of nutrients and pesticides) and
the (local) hydrological cycle (e.g., a higher water use).
(8) Agricultural practices for mitigation can have both positive and negative effects on conservation of water and on its quality.
(9) Reduced tillage promotes increased water-use efficiency.
(10) Afforestation generally improves groundwater quality and reduces soil erosion. It influences both catchment and regional hydrological cycles (a smoothed hydrograph,
thus reducing runoff and flooding). It generally gives better watershed protection, but at the expense of surface water yield and aquifer recharge, which may be critical
in semi-arid and arid regions.
(11) Stopping/slowing deforestation and forest degradation conserve water resources and prevent flooding, reduce run-off, control erosion and reduce siltation of rivers.
(12) The various waste management and wastewater control and treatment technologies can both reduce GHG emissions and have positive effects on the environment,
but they may cause water pollution in case of improperly designed or managed facilities.
(13) As conventional oil supplies become scarce and extraction costs increase, unconventional liquid fuels will become more economically attractive, but this is offset by
greater environmental costs (a high water demand; sanitation costs).

treatment of nutrient-rich wastewater and sludge, and provide
habitats for biodiversity in the agricultural landscape (Berndes
and Börjesson, 2002; Berndes et al., 2004; Börjesson and
Berndes, 2006). [WGIII 8.8] In the case of forest plantations
for obtaining bio-fuels, negative environmental impacts are
avoidable through good project design. Environmental benefits
include, among others, reduced soil degradation, water runoff,
and downstream siltation and capture of polluting agricultural
runoff. [LULUCF Fact Sheet 4.21]
6.2.3 Biomass electricity (3)
Non-hydro renewable energy supply technologies, particularly
solar, wind, geothermal and biomass, are currently small
overall contributors to global heat and electricity supply, but
are increasing most rapidly, albeit from a low base. Growth of
biomass electricity is restricted due to cost, as well as social and
environmental barriers. [WGIII 4.ES] For the particular case
of biomass electricity, any volumes of biomass needed above
those available from agricultural and forest residues [WGIII
Chapters 8 and 9] will need to be purpose-grown, so could be
constrained by land and water availability. There is considerable
uncertainty, but there should be sufficient production possible
in all regions to meet the additional generation from bio-energy
of 432 TWh/yr by 2030, as projected in this analysis. [WGIII
4.4.4] In general, the substitution of fossil fuels by biomass in
electricity generation will reduce the amount of cooling water
discharged to surface water streams.
6.2.4 Hydropower (4)
Renewable energy systems such as hydro-electricity can
contribute to the security of energy supply and protection of the
environment . However, construction of hydro-electric power
plants may also cause ecological impacts on existing river
ecosystems and fisheries, induced by changes in flow regime
(the hydrograph) and evaporative water losses (in the case of
dam-based power-houses). Also social disruption may be an
impact. Finally, water availability for shipping (water depth)
may cause problems. Positive effects are flow regulation, flood
control, and availability of water for irrigation during dry
seasons. Furthermore, hydropower does not require water for
cooling (as in the case of thermal power plants) or, as in the
case of bio-fuels, for growth. About 75% of water reservoirs
in the world were built for irrigation, flood control and urban
water supply schemes, and many could have small hydropower
generation retrofits added without additional environmental
impacts. [WGIII 4.3.3]
Large (>10 MW) hydro-electricity systems accounted for over
2,800 TWh of consumer energy in 2004 and provided 16% of
global electricity (90% of renewable electricity). Hydro projects
under construction could increase the share of hydro-electricity
by about 4.5% on completion and new projects could be
deployed to provide a further 6,000 TWh/yr or more of electricity
economically, mainly in developing countries. Repowering
existing plants with more powerful and efficient turbine designs
can be cost-effective whatever the plant scale. [WGIII 4.3.3.1]
Small (<10 MW) and micro (<1 MW) hydropower systems,
usually run-of-river schemes, have provided electricity to many
rural communities in developing countries such as Nepal. Their
present generation output is uncertain, with predictions ranging
from 4 TWh/yr to 9% of total hydropower output at 250 TWh/
yr. The global technical potential of small and micro-hydro is
around 150–200 GW, with many unexploited resource sites
available. [WGIII 4.3.3.1]
The many benefits of hydro-electricity, including irrigation and
water supply resource creation, rapid response to grid demand
fluctuations due to peaks or intermittent renewables, recreational
lakes, and flood control, as well as the negative aspects, need to
be evaluated for any given development. [WGIII 4.3.3.1]
6.2.5 Geothermal energy (5)
Geothermal resources have long been used for direct heat
extraction for district urban heating, industrial processing,
domestic water and space heating, leisure and balneotherapy
applications. [WGIII 4.3.3.4]
Geothermal fields of natural steam are rare, most being a
mixture of steam and hot water requiring single or double flash
systems to separate out the hot water, which can then be used
in binary plants or for direct heating. Re-injection of the fluids
maintains a constant pressure in the reservoir, hence increasing
the field’s life and reducing concerns about environmental
impacts. [WGIII 4.3.3.4]
Sustainability concerns relating to land subsidence, heat
extraction rates exceeding natural replenishment (Bromley
and Currie, 2003), chemical pollution of waterways (e.g., with
arsenic), and associated CO2 emissions have resulted in some
geothermal power plant permits being declined. This could be
partly overcome by re-injection techniques. Deeper drilling
technology could help to develop widely abundant hot dry rocks
where water is injected into artificially fractured rocks and heat
extracted as steam. However, at the same time, this means a
claim on available water resources. [WGIII 4.3.3.4]
6.2.6 Energy use in buildings (6)
Evaporative cooling, as a mitigation measure, means substantial
savings in annual cooling energy use for residences. However,
this type of cooling places an extra pressure on available water
resources. Cooling energy use in buildings can be reduced by
different measures, for example reducing the cooling load by
building shape and orientation. Reducing this energy means,
in the case of using water for cooling, a lower water demand.
[WGIII 6.4.4]
6.2.7 Land-use change and management (7)
According to IPCC Good Practice Guidance for LULUCF,
there are six possible broad land-use categories: forest land,
cropland, grassland, wetlands, settlements, and other. Changes
in land use (e.g., conversion of cropland to grassland) may
120
Climate change mitigation measures and water Section 6
result in net changes in carbon stocks and in different impacts
on water resources. For land-use changes other than land
converted to forest (as discussed in Section 6.2.10), previous
IPCC documents contain very few references to their impacts
on water resources. Wetland restoration, one of the main
mitigation practices in agriculture [WGIII 8.4.1.3], results
in the improvement of water quality and decreased flooding.
[LULUCF Table 4.10] Set-aside, another mitigation practice
identified by WGIII, may have positive impacts on both water
conservation and water quality. [WGIII Table 8.12]
Land management practices implemented for climate change
mitigation may also have different impacts on water resources.
Many of the practices advocated for soil carbon conservation –
reduced tillage, more vegetative cover, greater use of perennial
crops – also prevent erosion, yielding possible benefits for
improved water and air quality (Cole et al., 1993). These
practices may also have other potential adverse effects, at least
in some regions or conditions. Possible effects include enhanced
contamination of groundwater with nutrients or pesticides via
leaching under reduced tillage (Cole et al., 1993; Isensee and
Sadeghi, 1996). These possible negative effects, however,
have not been widely confirmed or quantified, and the extent
to which they may offset the environmental benefits of carbon
sequestration is uncertain. [WGIII TAR 4.4.2]
The group of practices known as agriculture intensification (Lal
et al., 1999; Bationo et al., 2000; Resck et al., 2000; Swarup
et al., 2000), including those that enhance production and the
input of plant-derived residues to soil (crop rotations, reduced
bare fallow, cover crops, high-yielding varieties, integrated
pest management, adequate fertilisation, organic amendments,
irrigation, water-table management, site-specific management,
and others), has numerous ancillary benefits, the most important
of which is the increase and maintenance of food production.
Environmental benefits can include erosion control, water
conservation, improved water quality, and reduced siltation of
reservoirs and waterways. Soil and water quality is adversely
affected by the indiscriminate use of agriculture inputs and
irrigation water. [LULUCF Fact Sheet 4.1]
Nutrient management to achieve efficient use of fertilisers
has positive impacts on water quality. [WGIII Table 8.12] In
addition, practices that reduce N2O emission often improve the
efficiency of nitrogen use from these and other sources (e.g.,
manures), thereby also reducing GHG emissions from fertiliser
manufacture and avoiding deleterious effects on water and air
quality from nitrogen pollutants (Dalal et al., 2003; Paustian
et al., 2004; Oenema et al., 2005; Olesen et al., 2006). [WGIII
8.8]
Agro-forestry systems (plantation of trees in cropland) can
provide multiple benefits including energy to rural communities
with synergies between sustainable development and GHG
mitigation. [LULUCF 4.5.1] However, agro-forestry may have
negative impacts on water conservation. [WGIII Table 8.12]
6.2.8 Cropland management (water) (8)
Agricultural practices which promote the mitigation of
greenhouse gases can have both negative and positive effects
on the conservation of water, and on its quality. Where the
measures promote water-use efficiency (e.g., reduced tillage),
they provide potential benefits. But in some cases, the practices
could intensify water use, thereby reducing streamflow or
groundwater reserves (Unkovich, 2003; Dias de Oliveira et
al., 2005). Rice management has generally positive impacts on
water quality through a reduction in the amount of chemical
pollutants in drainage water. [WGIII Table 8.12]
6.2.9 Cropland management (reduced tillage) (9)
Conservation tillage is a generic term that includes a wide
range of tillage practices, including chisel plough, ridge till,
strip till, mulch till and no till (CTIC, 1998). Adoption of
conservation tillage has numerous ancillary benefits. Important
among these benefits are the control of water and wind erosion,
water conservation, increased water-holding capacity, reduced
compaction, increased soil resilience to chemical inputs,
increased soil and air quality, enhanced soil biodiversity,
reduced energy use, improved water quality, reduced siltation
of reservoirs and waterways, and possible double-cropping.
In some areas (e.g., Australia), increased leaching from
greater water retention with conservation tillage can cause
downslope salinisation. [LULUCF Fact Sheet 4.3] Important
secondary benefits of conservation tillage adoption include soil
erosion reduction, improvements in water quality, increased
fuel efficiency, and increases in crop productivity. [LULUCF
4.4.2.4] Tillage/residue management has positive impacts on
water conservation. [WGIII Table 8.12]
6.2.10 Afforestation or reforestation (10)
Forests, generally, are expected to use more water (the sum
of transpiration and evaporation of water intercepted by tree
canopies) than crops, grass, or natural short vegetation. This
effect, occurring in lands that are subjected to afforestation or
reforestation, may be related to increased interception loss,
especially where the canopy is wet for a large proportion of the
year (Calder, 1990) or, in drier regions, to the development of
more massive root systems, which allow water extraction and
use during prolonged dry seasons. [LULUCF 2.5.1.1.4]
Interception losses are greatest from forests that have large leaf
areas throughout the year. Thus, such losses tend to be greater
for evergreen forests than for deciduous forests (Hibbert, 1967;
Schulze, 1982) and may be expected to be larger for fast-growing
forests with high rates of carbon storage than for slow-growing
forests. Consequently, afforestation with fast-growing conifers
on non-forest land commonly decreases the flow of water from
catchments and can cause water shortages during droughts
(Hibbert, 1967; Swank and Douglass, 1974). Vincent (1995),
for example, found that establishing high-water-demanding
121
Section 6 Climate change mitigation measures and water
species of pines to restore degraded Thai watersheds markedly
reduced dry season streamflows relative to the original
deciduous forests. Although forests lower average flows, they
may reduce peak flows and increase flows during dry seasons
because forested lands tend to have better infiltration capacity
and a high capacity to retain water (Jones and Grant, 1996).
Forests also play an important role in improving water quality.
[LULUCF 2.5.1.1.4]
In many regions of the world where forests grow above shallow
saline water tables, decreased water use following deforestation
can cause water tables to rise, bringing salt to the surface (Morris
and Thomson, 1983). In such situations, high water use by trees
(e.g., through afforestation or reforestation) can be of benefit
(Schofield, 1992). [LULUCF 2.5.1.1.4]
In the dry tropics, forest plantations often use more water than
short vegetation because trees can access water at greater depth
and evaporate more intercepted water. Newly planted forests
can use more water (by transpiration and interception) than
the annual rainfall, by mining stored water (Greenwood et al.,
1985). Extensive afforestation or reforestation in the dry tropics
can therefore have a serious impact on supplies of groundwater
and river flows. It is less clear, however, whether replacing
natural forests with plantations, even with exotic species,
increases water use in the tropics when there is no change
in rooting depth or stomatal behaviour of the tree species. In
the dry zone of India, water use by Eucalyptus plantations is
similar to that of indigenous dry deciduous forest: both forest
types essentially utilise all the annual rainfall (Calder, 1992).
[LULUCF 2.5.1.1.4]
Afforestation and reforestation, like forest protection, may also
have beneficial hydrological effects. After afforestation in wet
areas, the amount of direct runoff initially decreases rapidly,
then gradually becomes constant, and baseflow increases
slowly as stand age increases towards maturity (Fukushima,
1987; Kobayashi, 1987), suggesting that reforestation and
afforestation help to reduce flooding and enhance water
conservation. In water-limited areas, afforestation, especially
plantations of species with high water demand, can cause a
significant reduction in streamflow, affecting the inhabitants of
the basin (Le Maitre and Versfeld, 1997), and reducing water
flow to other ecosystems and rivers, thus affecting aquifers
and recharge (Jackson et al., 2005). In addition, some possible
changes in soil properties are largely driven by changes in
hydrology. The hydrological benefits of afforestation may need
to be evaluated individually for each site. [WGIII TAR 4.4.1]
Positive socio-economic benefits, such as wealth or job
creation, must be balanced by the loss of welfare resulting from
reductions in available water, grazing, natural resources, and
agricultural land. Afforestation of previously eroded or otherwise
degraded land may have a net positive environmental impact; in
catchments where the water yield is large or is not heavily used,
streamflow reduction may not be critical. [LULUCF 4.7.2.4]
6.2.11 Avoided/reduced deforestation (11)
Stopping or slowing deforestation and forest degradation (loss
of carbon density) and sustainable management of forests may
significantly contribute to avoided emissions, may conserve
water resources and prevent flooding, reduce runoff, control
erosion, reduce siltation of rivers, and protect fisheries and
investments in hydro-electric power facilities; and at the same
time preserve biodiversity (Parrotta, 2002). [WGIII 9.7.2]
Preserving forests conserves water resources and prevents
flooding. For example, the flood damage in Central America
following Hurricane Mitch was apparently enhanced by the
loss of forest cover. By reducing runoff, forests control erosion
and salinity. Consequently, maintaining forest cover can
reduce siltation of rivers, protecting fisheries and investment
in hydro-electric power facilities (Chomitz and Kumari, 1996).
[WGIII TAR 4.4.1]
Deforestation and degradation of upland catchments can
disrupt hydrological systems, replacing year-round water flows
in downstream areas with flood and drought regimes (Myers,
1997). Although there are often synergies between increased
carbon storage through afforestation, reforestation and
deforestation (ARD) activities and other desirable associated
impacts, no general rules can be applied; impacts must be
assessed individually for each specific case. Associated impacts
can often be significant, and the overall desirability of specific
ARD activities can be greatly affected by their associated
impacts. [LULUCF 3.6.2]
6.2.12 Solid waste management; wastewater
iiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiitreatment (12)
Controlled landfill (with or without gas recovery and utilisation)
controls and reduces GHG emissions but may have negative
impacts on water quality in the case of improperly managed sites.
This also holds for aerobic biological treatment (composting)
and anaerobic biological treatment (anaerobic digestion).
Recycling, reuse and waste minimisation can be negative for
waste scavenging from open dump sites, with water pollution
as a potential consequence. [WGIII Table 10.7]
When efficiently applied, wastewater transport and treatment
technologies reduce or eliminate GHG generation and
emissions. In addition, wastewater management promotes water
conservation by preventing pollution from untreated discharges
to surface water, groundwater, soils, and coastal zones, thus
reducing the volume of pollutants, and requiring a smaller
volume of water to be treated. [WGIII 10.4.6]
Treated wastewater can either be reused or discharged, but reuse
is the most desirable option for agricultural and horticultural
irrigation, fish aquaculture, artificial recharge of aquifers, or
industrial applications. [WGIII 10.4.6]
122
Climate change mitigation measures and water Section 6
6.2.13 Unconventional oil (13)
As conventional oil supplies become scarce and extraction
costs increase, unconventional liquid fuels will become more
economically attractive, although this is offset by greater
environmental costs (Williams et al., 2006). Mining and
upgrading of oil shale and oil sands requires the availability of
abundant water. Technologies for recovering tar sands include
open cast (surface) mining, where the deposits are shallow
enough, or injection of steam into wells in situ to reduce the
viscosity of the oil prior to extraction. The mining process uses
about four litres of water to produce one litre of oil but produces
a refinable product. The in situ process uses about two litres
of water to one litre of oil, but the very heavy product needs
cleaning and diluting (usually with naphtha) at the refinery or
needs to be sent to an upgrader to yield syncrude at an energy
efficiency of around 75% (NEB, 2006). The energy efficiency
of oil sand upgrading is around 75%. Mining of oil sands leaves
behind large quantities of pollutants and areas of disturbed land.
[WGIII 4.3.1.4]
As shown in the previous section, climate change mitigation
practices in various sectors may have an impact on water
resources. Conversely, water management policies and
measures can have an influence on GHG emissions associated
with different sectors, and thus on their respective mitigation
measures (Table 6.2).
6.3.1 Hydro dams (1)
About 75% of water reservoirs in the world were built for
irrigation, flood control and urban water supply schemes.
Greenhouse gas emissions vary with reservoir location, power
density (power capacity per area flooded), flow rate, and
whether the plant is dam-based or run-of-river type. Recently,
the greenhouse gas footprint of hydropower reservoirs has
been questioned. Some reservoirs have been shown to absorb
carbon dioxide at their surface, but most emit small amounts
of GHGs as water conveys carbon in the natural carbon cycle.
High emissions of methane have been recorded at shallow,
plateau-type tropical reservoirs where the natural carbon cycle
is most productive, while deep-water reservoirs exhibit lower
emissions. Methane from natural floodplains and wetlands
may be suppressed if they are inundated by a new reservoir,
since methane is oxidised as it rises through the water column.
Methane formation in freshwater involves by-product carbon
compounds (phenolic and humic acids) that effectively
sequester the carbon involved. For shallow tropical reservoirs,
further research is needed to establish the extent to which these
may increase methane emissions. [WGIII 4.3.3.1]
6.3 Effects of water management policies
iiiiiiiand measures on GHG emissions and
iiiiiiimitigation
The emission of greenhouse gases from reservoirs due to rotting
vegetation and carbon inflows from the catchment is a recently
identified ecosystem impact of dams. This challenges the
conventional wisdom that hydropower produces only positive
atmospheric effects (e.g., reductions in emissions of CO2 and
nitrous oxides), when compared with conventional power
generation sources (World Commission on Dams, 2000).
Lifecycle assessments of hydropower projects available at
the time of the AR4 showed low overall net greenhouse gas
emissions. Given that measuring the incremental anthropogenicrelated
emissions from freshwater reservoirs remains uncertain,
the UNFCCC Executive Board has excluded large hydro projects
with significant water storage from its Clean Development
Mechanism (CDM). [WGIII 4.3.3.1]
6.3.2 Irrigation (2)
About 18% of the world’s croplands now receive supplementary
water through irrigation (Millennium Ecosystem Assessment,
2005a, b). Expanding this area (where water reserves allow), or
using more effective irrigation measures, can enhance carbon
storage in soils through enhanced yields and residue returns
(Follett, 2001; Lal, 2004). However, some of these gains may be
offset by carbon dioxide from energy used to deliver the water
(Schlesinger, 1999; Mosier et al., 2005) or from N2O emissions
from higher moisture and fertiliser nitrogen inputs (Liebig et
al., 2005), though the latter effect has not been widely measured
[WGIII 8.4.1.1.d]. The expansion of wetland rice area may also
cause increased methane emissions from soils (Yan et al., 2003).
[WGIII 8.4.1.1.e]
6.3.3 Residue return (3)
Weed competition for water is an important cause of crop
failure or decreases in crop yields worldwide. Advances in weed
control methods and farm machinery now allow many crops
to be grown with minimal tillage (reduced tillage) or without
tillage (no-till). These practices, which result in the maintenance
of crop residues on the soil surface, thus avoiding water losses
by evaporation, are now being used increasingly throughout the
world (e.g., Cerri et al., 2004). Since soil disturbance tends to
stimulate soil carbon losses through enhanced decomposition
and erosion (Madari et al., 2005), reduced- or no-till agriculture
often results in soil carbon gain, though not always (West
and Post, 2002; Alvarez, 2005; Gregorich et al., 2005; Ogle
et al., 2005). Adopting reduced- or no-till may also affect
emissions of N2O, but the net effects are inconsistent and not
well quantified globally (Cassman et al., 2003; Smith and
Conen, 2004; Helgason et al., 2005; Li et al., 2005). The effect
of reduced tillage on N2O emissions may depend on soil and
climatic conditions: in some areas reduced tillage promotes
N2O emissions; elsewhere it may reduce emissions or have
no measurable influence (Marland et al., 2001). Furthermore,
no-tillage systems can reduce carbon dioxide emissions from

Notes:
(1) Hydropower does not require fossil fuel and is an important source of renewable energy. However, recently the GHG footprint of hydropower reservoirs has been
questioned. In particular, methane is a problem.
(2) Applying more effective irrigation measures can enhance carbon storage in soils through enhanced yields and residue returns, but some of these gains may be offset
by CO2 emissions from the energy used to deliver the water. Irrigation may also induce additional CH4 and N2O emissions, depending on case-specific
circumstances.
(3) Residue returned to the field, to improve water-holding capacity, will sequester carbon through both increased crop productivity and reduced soil respiration.
(4) Drainage of agricultural lands in humid regions can promote productivity (and hence soil carbon) and perhaps also suppress N2O emissions by improving aeration.
Any nitrogen lost through drainage, however, may be susceptible to loss as N2O.
(5) Depending on the design and management of facilities (wastewater treatment and treatment purification technologies), more or less CH4 and N2O emissions – the major
GHG emissions from wastewater – can be emitted during all stages from source to disposal; however, in practice, most emissions occur upstream of treatment.
(6) Desalinisation requires the use of energy, and thus generates GHG emissions.
(7) Using geothermal energy for heating purposes does not generate GHG emissions, as is the case with other methods of energy production.
Table 6.2: Influence of water management on sectoral GHG emissions. Increased GHG emissions are indicated with [−],
(because this implies a negative impact) and reduced GHG emissions with [+]. Numbers in round brackets refer to the Notes,
and also to the sub-section numbers in Section 6.3.
energy use (Marland et al., 2003; Koga et al., 2006). Systems
that retain crop residues also tend to increase soil carbon because
these residues are the precursors for soil organic matter, the
main store of carbon in soil. Avoiding the burning of residues
(e.g., mechanising the harvest of sugarcane, eliminating the
need for pre-harvest burning; Cerri et al., 2004), also avoids
emissions of aerosols and GHGs generated from fire, although
carbon dioxide emissions from fuel use may increase. [WGIII
8.4.1.1.c]
6.3.4 Drainage of cropland (4)
Drainage of croplands in humid regions can promote productivity
(and hence soil carbon) and perhaps also suppress N2O emissions
by improving aeration (Monteny et al., 2006). Any nitrogen lost
through drainage, however, may be susceptible to loss as N2O
(Reay et al., 2003). [WGIII 8.4.1.1.d]
6.3.5 Wastewater treatment (5)
For landfill CH4, the largest GHG emission source from the
waste sector, emissions continue several decades after waste
disposal, and thus estimation of emission trends requires models
which include temporal trends. CH4 is also emitted during
wastewater transport, sewage treatment processes, and leakage
from anaerobic digestion of waste or wastewater sludges.
The major sources of N2O are human sewage and wastewater
treatment. [WGIII 10.3.1]
The methane emissions from wastewater alone are expected
to increase by almost 50% between 1990 and 2020, especially
in the rapidly developing countries of eastern and southern
Asia. Estimates of global N2O emissions from wastewater are
incomplete and based only on human sewage treatment, but
these indicate an increase of 25% between 1990 and 2020. It
is important to emphasise, however, that these are businessas-
usual scenarios, and actual emissions could be much lower
if additional measures were put in place. Future reductions in
emissions from the waste sector will partially depend on the
post-2012 availability of Kyoto mechanisms such as the CDM.
[WGIII 10.3.1]
In developing countries, due to rapid population growth and
urbanisation without concurrent development of wastewater
infrastructure, CH4 and N2O emissions from wastewater are
generally higher than in developed countries. This can be seen
by examining the 1990 estimated methane and N2O emissions
and projected trends to 2020 from wastewater and human
sewage. [WGIII 10.3.3]
Although current GHG emissions from wastewater are lower
than emissions from waste, it is recognised that there are
substantial emissions that are not quantified by current estimates,
especially from septic tanks, latrines, and uncontrolled discharges
in developing countries. Decentralised ‘natural’ treatment
processes and septic tanks in developing countries may result
in relatively large emissions of methane and N2O, particularly
124
Climate change mitigation measures and water Section 6
in China, India and Indonesia. Open sewers or informally
ponded wastewaters in developing countries often result in
uncontrolled discharges to rivers and lakes, causing rapidly
increasing wastewater volumes going along with economic
development. On the other hand, low-water-use toilets (3–
5 litres) and ecological sanitation approaches (including
ecological toilets) where nutrients are safely recycled into
productive agriculture and the environment, are being used
in Mexico, Zimbabwe, China and Sweden. These could also
be applied in many developing and developed countries,
especially where there are water shortages, irregular water
supplies, or where additional measures for the conservation
of water resources are needed. All of these measures also
encourage smaller wastewater treatment plants with reduced
nutrient loads and proportionally lower GHG emissions.
[WGIII 10.6.2] All in all, the quantity of wastewater
collected and treated is increasing in many countries in order
to maintain and improve potable water quality, as well for
other public health and environmental protection benefits.
Concurrently, GHG emissions from wastewater will decrease
relative to future increases in wastewater collection and
treatment. [WGIII 10.6.2]
6.3.6 Desalinisation (6)
In water-scarce regions, water supply may take place (partly)
by desalinisation of saline water. Such a process requires
energy and this implies the generation of GHG emissions in
the case of fossil-fuel utilisation. [WGII 3.3.2]
6.3.7 Geothermal energy (7)
Using geothermal energy for heating purposes does not
generate GHG emissions, as is the case with other methods
of energy generation (see also Section 6.2.5).
Possible conflicts between adaptation and mitigation might arise
over water resources. The few studies that exist (e.g., Dang et al.,
2003) indicate that the repercussions from mitigation for adaptation
and vice versa are mostly marginal at the global level, although they
may be significant at the regional scale. In regions where climate
change will trigger significant shifts in the hydrological regime, but
where hydropower potentials are still available, this would increase
the competition for water, especially if climate change adaptation
efforts in various sectors are implemented (such as competition for
surface water resources between irrigation, to cope with climate
change impacts in agriculture, increased demand for drinking water,
and increased demand for cooling water for the power sector). This
confirms the importance of integrated land and water management
strategies for river basins, to ensure the optimal allocation of scarce
natural resources (land, water). Also, both mitigation and adaptation
have to be evaluated at the same time, with explicit trade-offs, in
order to optimise economic investments while fostering sustainable
development.[WGII 18.8, 18.4.3]
Several studies confirm potential clashes between water supply,
flood control, hydropower and minimum streamflow (required for
ecological and water quality purposes) under changing climatic and
hydrological conditions (Christensen et al., 2004; Van Rheenen et
al., 2004). [WGII 18.4.3]
Adaptation to changing hydrological regimes and water
availability will also require continuous additional energy input.
In water-scarce regions, the increasing reuse of wastewater and
the associated treatment, deep-well pumping, and especially largescale
desalination, would increase energy use in the water sector
(Boutkan and Stikker, 2004), thus generating GHG emissions,
unless ‘clean energy’ options are used to generate the necessary
energy input. [WGII 18.4.3]

Implications for policy and
sustainable development

127
Section 7 Implications for policy and sustainable development
7.1 Implications for policy by sector
Climate change poses a major conceptual challenge to water
managers, water resource users (e.g., in agriculture) as well
as to policymakers in general, as it is no longer appropriate
to assume that past climatic and hydrological conditions will
continue into the future. Water resources management clearly
impacts on many other policy areas (e.g., energy, health, food
security, nature conservation). Thus, the appraisal of adaptation
and mitigation options needs to be conducted across multiple
water-dependent sectors.
Substantial changes have been observed over recent decades
in many water-related variables, but clear formal attribution
of the observed changes to natural or anthropogenic causes
is not generally possible at present. Projections of future
precipitation, soil moisture and runoff at regional scales are
subject to substantial uncertainty. In many regions, models
do not agree on the sign of projected change. However, some
robust patterns are found across climate model projections.
Increases in precipitation (and river flow) are very likely at high
latitudes and in some wet tropics (including populous areas in
east and south-east Asia), and decreases are very likely over
much of the mid-latitudes and dry tropics [WGII Figure 3.4].
Interpretation and quantification of uncertainties has recently
improved, and new methods (e.g., ensemble-based approaches)
are being developed for their characterisation [WGII 3.4,
3.5]. Nevertheless, quantitative projections of changes in
precipitation, river flows and water levels at the river-basin
scale remain uncertain, so that planning decisions involving
climate change must be made in the context of this uncertainty.
[WGII TS, 3.3.1, 3.4]
Effective adaptation to climate change occurs across temporal
and spatial scales, including incorporation of lessons from
responses to climate variability into longer-term vulnerability
reduction efforts and within governance mechanisms from
communities and watersheds to international agreements.
Continued investment in adaptation in response to historical
experience alone, rather than projected future conditions
that will include both variability and change, is likely to
increase the vulnerability of many sectors to climate change.
[WGII TS, 14.5]
Drought-affected areas are likely to increase; and extreme
precipitation events, which are very likely to increase in
frequency and intensity, will augment flood risk. Up to
20% of the world’s population live in river basins that are
likely to be affected by increased flood hazard by the 2080s
in the course of climate change. [WGII 3.4.3]
Semi-arid and arid areas are particularly exposed to the
impacts of climate change on freshwater. Many of these
areas (e.g., the Mediterranean Basin, western USA,
southern Africa, north-eastern Brazil, southern and eastern
Australia) will suffer a decrease in water resources due to
climate change. [WGII Box TS.5, 3.4, 3.7] Efforts to offset
declining surface water availability due to increasing
precipitation variability will be hampered by the fact that
groundwater recharge is projected to decrease considerably
in some water-stressed regions [WGII 3.4.2], exacerbated
by the increased water demand. [WGII 3.5.1]
Higher water temperatures, increased precipitation
intensity and longer periods of low flows exacerbate many
forms of water pollution, with impacts on ecosystems,
human health, and water system reliability and operating
costs. [WGII 3.2, 3.4.4, 3.4.5]
Areas in which runoff is projected to decline will face
a reduction in the value of services provided by water
resources. The beneficial impacts of increased annual
runoff in some other areas will be tempered by the negative
effects of increased precipitation variability and seasonal
runoff shifts on water supply, water quality and flood risks.
[WGII 3.4, 3.5]
At the global level, the negative impacts of climate change
on freshwater systems outweigh the benefits. [WGII 3.4,
3.5]
Adverse effects of climate on freshwater systems
aggravate the impacts of other stresses, such as population
growth, land-use change and urbanisation. [WGII 3.3.2,
3.5] Globally, water demand will grow in the coming
decades, primarily due to population growth and increased
affluence. [WGII 3.5.1]
Climate change affects the function and operation of existing
water infrastructure as well as water management practices.
Current water management practices are very likely to be
inadequate to reduce the negative impacts of climate change
on water-supply reliability, flood risk, health, energy and
aquatic ecosystems. [WGII TS, 3.4, 3.5, 3.6]
Adaptation procedures and risk management practices for
the water sector are being developed in some countries
and regions (e.g., the Caribbean, Canada, Australia, the
Netherlands, the UK, the USA and Germany) that recognise
the uncertainty of projected hydrological changes, but
evaluation criteria on effectiveness need to be developed.
[WGII 3.6]
Ecosystems
The resilience of many ecosystems and their ability
to adapt naturally is likely to be exceeded by 2100 by
an unprecedented combination of change in climate,
associated disturbances (e.g., flooding, drought, wildfire)
and other global change drivers (e.g., land-use change,

Water resource management
Catchments that are dominated by seasonal snow cover
already experience earlier peak flows in spring, and this
shift is expected to continue under a warmer climate. At
lower altitudes, winter precipitation will increasingly
be in the form of rainfall instead of snowfall. In many
mountain areas, e.g., in the tropical Andes and many
Asian mountains, where glaciers provide the main runoff
during pronounced dry seasons, water volumes stored in
glaciers and snow cover are projected to decline. Runoff
during warm and dry seasons is enhanced while glaciers
are shrinking, but will dramatically drop after they have
disappeared. [WGII 3.4.1]

Implications for policy and sustainable development Section 7
pollution, over-exploitation of resources). [WGII TS]
Greater rainfall variability is likely to compromise wetlands
through shifts in the timing, duration and depth of water
levels. [WGII 4.4.8]
Of all ecosystems, freshwater ecosystems will have the
highest proportion of species threatened with extinction
due to climate change. [WGII 4.4.8]
Current conservation practices are generally poorly
prepared to adapt to the projected changes in water
resources during the coming decades. [WGII 4.ES]
Effective adaptation responses that will conserve
biodiversity and other ecosystem services are likely to
be costly to implement, but unless conservation water
needs are factored into adaptation strategies, many natural
ecosystems and the species they support will decline.
[WGII 4.ES, 4.4.11, Table 4.1, 4.6.1, 4.6.2]
Agriculture, forests
An increased frequency of droughts and floods negatively
affects crop yields and livestock, with impacts that are
both larger and earlier than predicted by using changes
in mean variables alone. [WGII 5.4.1, 5.4.2] Increases in
the frequency of droughts and floods will have a negative
effect on local production, especially in subsistence sectors
at low latitudes. [WGII SPM]
Impacts of climate change on irrigation water requirements
may be large. [WGII 5.4] New water storages, both surface
and underground, can alleviate water shortages but are not
always feasible. [WGII 5.5.2]
Farmers may be able to partially adjust by changing
cultivars and/or planting dates for annual crops and by
adopting other strategies. The potential for higher water
needs should be considered in the design of new irrigation
supply systems and in the rehabilitation of old systems.
[WGII 5.5.1]
Measures to combat water scarcity, such as the reuse of
wastewater for agriculture, need to be carefully managed
to avoid negative impacts on occupational health and food
safety. [WGII 8.6.4]
Unilateral measures to address water shortages due to
climate change can lead to competition for water resources.
International and regional approaches are required in order
to develop joint solutions. [WGII 5.7]
Coastal systems and low-lying areas
Sea-level rise will extend areas of salinisation of
groundwater and estuaries, resulting in a decrease in
freshwater availability. [WGII 3.2, 3.4.2]
Settlements in low-lying coastal areas that have low
adaptive capacity and/or high exposure are at increased
risk from floods and sea-level rise. Such areas include
river deltas, especially Asian megadeltas (e.g., the Ganges-
Brahmaputra in Bangladesh and west Bengal), and lowlying
coastal urban areas, especially areas prone to natural
or human-induced subsidence and tropical storm landfall
(e.g., New Orleans, Shanghai). [WGII 6.3, 6.4]

Industry, settlement and society
Infrastructure, such as urban water supply systems, are
vulnerable, especially in coastal areas, to sea-level rise and
reduced regional precipitation. [WGII 7.4.3, 7.5]
Projected increases in extreme precipitation events have
important implications for infrastructure: design of storm
drainage, road culverts and bridges, levees and flood
control works, including sizing of flood control detention
reservoirs. [WGII 7.4.3.2]
Planning regulations can be used to prevent development
in high-flood-risk zones (e.g., on floodplains), including
housing, industrial development and siting of landfill sites
etc. [WGII 7.6]
Infrastructure development, with its long lead times and
large investments, would benefit from incorporating
climate-change information. [WGII 14.5.3, Figure 14.3]
Sanitation and human health
Climate-change-induced effects on water pose a threat
to human health through changes in water quality and
availability. Although access to water supplies and
sanitation is determined primarily by non-climate factors, in
some populations climate change is expected to exacerbate
problems of access at the household level. [WGII 8.2.5]
Appropriate disaster planning and preparedness need to be
developed in order to address the increased risk of flooding
due to climate change and to reduce impacts on health and
health systems. [WGII 8.2.2]
Climate information needs
Progress in understanding the climate impact on the water
cycle depends on improved data availability. Relatively short
hydrometric records can underestimate the full extent of
natural variability. Comprehensive monitoring of water-related
variables, in terms of both quantity and quality, supports decision
making and is a prerequisite for the adaptive management
required under conditions of climate change. [WGII 3.8]

7.2 The main water-related projected
iiiiiiiimpacts by regions
Africa
The impacts of climate change in Africa are likely to
be greatest where they co-occur with a range of other
stresses (population growth; unequal access to resources;
inadequate access to water and sanitation [WGII 9.4.1];
food insecurity [WGII 9.6]; poor health systems [WGII
9.2.2, 9.4.3]). These stresses and climate change will
increase the vulnerabilities of many people in Africa.
[WGII 9.4]
An increase of 5–8% (60–90 million ha) of arid and semiarid
land in Africa is projected by the 2080s under a range
of climate change scenarios. [WGII 9.4.4]
Declining agricultural yields are likely due to drought and
land degradation, especially in marginal areas. Mixed rainfed
systems in the Sahel will be greatly affected by climate
•
•
•
129
Section 7 Implications for policy and sustainable development
change. Mixed rain-fed and highland perennial systems in
the Great Lakes region and in other parts of East Africa
will also be severely affected. [WGII 9.4.4, Box TS.6]
Current water stress in Africa is likely to be increased by
climate change, but water governance and water-basin
management must also be considered in future assessments
of water stress in Africa. Increases in runoff in East Africa
(and increased risk of flood events) and decreases in
runoff (and increased risk of drought) in other areas (e.g.,
southern Africa) are projected by the 2050s. [WGII 9.4.1,
9.4.2, 9.4.8]
Any changes in the primary production of large lakes
will have important impacts on local food supplies. Lake
Tanganyika currently provides 25–40% of animal protein
intake for the surrounding populations, and climate
change is likely to reduce primary production and possible
fish yields by roughly 30% [WGII 9.4.5, 3.4.7, 5.4.5].
The interaction of poor human management decisions,
including over-fishing, is likely to further reduce fish yields
from lakes. [WGII 9.2.2, Box TS.6]
Asia
The per capita availability of freshwater in India is expected
to drop from around 1,820 m3 currently to below 1,000 m3
by 2025 in response to the combined effects of population
growth and climate change. [WGII 10.4.2.3]
More intense rain and more frequent flash floods during
the monsoon would result in a higher proportion of runoff
and a reduction in the proportion reaching the groundwater.
[WGII 10.4.2]
Agricultural irrigation demand in arid and semi-arid
regions of east Asia is expected to increase by 10% for an
increase in temperature of 1°C. [WGII 10.4.1]
Coastal areas, especially heavily populated Asian
megadelta regions, will be at greatest risk due to increased
flooding from the sea and, in some megadeltas, flooding
from rivers. [WGII 6.4, 10.4.3]
Changes in snow and glacier melt, as well as rising
snowlines in the Himalayas, will affect seasonal
variation in runoff, causing water shortages during dry
summer months. One-quarter of China’s population and
hundreds of millions in India will be affected (Stern,
2007). [WGII 3.4.1, 10.4.2.1]
Australia and New Zealand
Ongoing water security problems are very likely to increase
in southern and eastern Australia (e.g., a 0–45% decline in
runoff in Victoria by 2030 and a 10–25% reduction in river
flow in Australia’s Murray-Darling Basin by 2050) and,
in New Zealand, in Northland and some eastern regions.
[WGII 11.4.1]
Risks to major infrastructure are likely to increase due
to climate change. Design criteria for extreme events
are very likely to be exceeded more frequently by 2030.
Risks include failure of floodplain levees and urban
drainage systems, and flooding of coastal towns near
rivers. [WGII 11.ES, 11.4.5, 11.4.7]
•

•
•
•

•
Production from agriculture and forestry by 2030 is
projected to decline over much of southern and eastern
Australia, and over parts of eastern New Zealand, due
to, among other things, increased drought. However, in
New Zealand, initial benefits are projected in western and
southern areas and close to major rivers, with increased
rainfall. [WGII 11.4]
Europe
The probability of an extreme winter precipitation
exceeding two standard deviations above normal is
expected to increase by up to a factor of five in parts of the
UK and northern Europe by the 2080s with a doubling of
CO2. [WGII 12.3.1]
By the 2070s, annual runoff is projected to increase in
northern Europe, and decrease by up to 36% in southern
Europe, with summer low flows reduced by up to 80%
under the IS92a scenario. [WGII 12.4.1, T12.2]
The percentage of river-basin area in the severe water
stress category (withdrawal:availability ratio greater than
0.4) is expected to increase from 19% today to 34–36% by
the 2070s. [WGII 12.4.1]
The number of additional people living in water-stressed
watersheds in 17 countries in western Europe is likely
to increase by 16–44 million (HadCM3 climate model
results) by the 2080s. [WGII 12.4.1]
By the 2070s, hydropower potential for the whole of
Europe is expected to decline by 6%, with strong regional
variations from a 20–50% decrease in the Mediterranean
region to a 15–30% increase in northern and eastern
Europe. [WGII 12.4.8]
Small mountain glaciers in different regions will disappear,
while larger glaciers will suffer a volume reduction
between 30% and 70% by 2050 under a range of emissions
scenarios, with concomitant reductions in discharge in
spring and summer. [WGII 12.4.3]
Latin America
Any future reductions in rainfall in arid and semi-arid
regions of Argentina, Chile and Brazil are likely to lead to
severe water shortages. [WGII 13.4.3]
Due to climate change and population growth, the number
of people living in water-stressed watersheds is projected
to reach 37–66 million by the 2020s (compared to an
estimate of 56 million without climate change) for the
SRES A2 scenario. [WGII 13.4.3]
Areas in Latin America with severe water stress include
eastern Central America, the plains, Motagua Valley and
Pacific slopes of Guatemala, eastern and western regions
of El Salvador, the central valley and Pacific region of
Costa Rica, the northern, central and western intermontane
regions of Honduras, and the peninsula of Azuero in
Panama). In these areas, water supply and hydro-electricity
generation could be seriously affected by climate change.

Flood risk is expected to grow during the wet season.
[WGII 13.2.4, 13.4.3]
North America
Projected warming in the western mountains by the mid-
21st century is very likely to cause large decreases in
snowpack, earlier snowmelt, more winter rain events,
increased peak winter flows and flooding, and reduced
summer flows. [WGII 14.4.1]
Reduced water supplies coupled with increases in demand
are likely to exacerbate competition for over-allocated
water resources. [WGII 14.2.1, Box 14.2]
Moderate climate change in the early decades of the
century is projected to increase aggregate yields of rainfed
agriculture by 5–20%, but with important variability
among regions. Major challenges are projected for crops
that are near the warm end of their suitable range or which
depend on highly utilised water resources. [WGII 14.4.4]
Vulnerability to climate change is likely to be concentrated
in specific groups and regions, including indigenous
peoples and others dependent on narrow resource bases,
and the poor and elderly in cities. [WGII 14.2.6, 14.4.6]
Polar regions
Northern Hemisphere permafrost extent is likely to decrease
by 20–35% by 2050. The depth of seasonal thawing is
projected to increase by 15–25% in most areas by 2050, and
by 50% or more in northernmost locations under the full range
of SRES scenarios. [WGII 15.3.4] In the Arctic, disruption
of ecosystems is projected as a result. [WGII 15.4.1]
Further reductions in lake and river ice cover are expected,
affecting thermal structures, the quality/quantity of
under-ice habitats and, in the Arctic, the timing and
severity of ice jamming and related flooding. Freshwater
warming is expected to influence the productivity
and distribution of aquatic species, especially fish,
leading to changes in fish stock, and reductions in
those species that prefer colder waters. [WGII 15.4.1]
Increases in the frequency and severity of flooding, erosion
and destruction of permafrost threaten Arctic communities,
industrial infrastructure and water supply. [WGII 15.4.6]
Small islands
There is strong evidence that, under most climate change
scenarios, water resources in small islands are likely to be
seriously compromised [WGII 16.ES]. Most small islands
have a limited water supply, and water resources in these
islands are especially vulnerable to future changes and
distribution of rainfall. Many islands in the Caribbean are
likely to experience increased water stress as a result of
climate change. Under all SRES scenarios, reduced rainfall
in summer is projected for this region, so that it is unlikely
that demand would be met during low rainfall periods.
Increased rainfall in winter is unlikely to compensate, due
to the lack of storage and high runoff during storm events.

A reduction in average rainfall would lead to a reduction
in the size of the freshwater lens. In the Pacific, a 10%
reduction in average rainfall (by 2050) would lead to a
20% reduction in the size of the freshwater lens on Tarawa
Atoll, Kiribati. Reduced rainfall, coupled with increased
withdrawals, sea-level rise and attendant salt-water
intrusion, would compound this threat. [WGII 16.4.1]
Several small-island countries (e.g., Barbados, Maldives,
Seychelles and Tuvalu) have begun to invest in the
implementation of adaptation strategies, including
desalination, to offset current and projected water
shortages. [WGII 16.4.1]

7.3 Implications for climate mitigation
iiiiiiipolicy
Implementing important mitigation options such as
afforestation, hydropower and bio-fuels may have positive and
negative impacts on freshwater resources, depending on sitespecific
situations. Therefore, site-specific joint evaluation and
optimisation of (the effectiveness of) mitigation measures and
water-related impacts are needed.
Expansion of irrigated areas and dam-based hydro-electric
power generation can lead to reduced effectiveness of associated
mitigation potential. In the case of irrigation, CO2 emissions
due to energy consumption for pumping water and to methane
emissions in rice fields may partly offset any mitigation effects.
Freshwater reservoirs for hydropower generation may produce
some greenhouse gas emissions, so that an overall case-specific
evaluation of the ultimate greenhouse gas budget is needed.
[WGIII 4.3.3.1, 8.4.1.1]
7.4 Implications for sustainable
iiiiiiidevelopment
Low-income countries and regions are expected to remain
vulnerable over the medium term, with fewer options than highincome
countries for adapting to climate change. Therefore,
adaptation strategies should be designed in the context of
development, environment and health policies. Many of the
options that can be used to reduce future vulnerability are of
value in adapting to current climate and can be used to achieve
other environmental and social objectives.
In many regions of the globe, climate change impacts on
freshwater resources may affect sustainable development
and put at risk the reduction of poverty and child mortality
(Table 7.1). It is very likely that negative impacts of increased
frequency and severity of floods and droughts on sustainable
development cannot be avoided [WGII 3.7]. However, aside
from major extreme events, climate change is seldom the
main factor exerting stress on sustainability. The significance
of climate change lies in its interactions with other sources of
change and stress, and its impacts should be considered in such
a multi-cause context. [WGII 7.1.3, 7.2, 7.4]

8.1 Observational needs
There is abundant evidence from observational records and
climate projections that freshwater resources are vulnerable
and have the potential to be strongly impacted by climate
change. However, the ability to quantify future changes in
hydrological variables, and their impacts on systems and
sectors, is limited by uncertainty at all stages of the assessment
process. Uncertainty comes from the range of socio-economic
development scenarios, the range of climate model projections
for a given scenario, the downscaling of climate effects to
local/regional scales, impacts assessments, and feedbacks from
adaptation and mitigation activities. Limitations in observations
and understanding restrict our current ability to reduce these
uncertainties. Decision making needs to operate in the context
of this uncertainty. Robust methods to assess risks based on
these uncertainties are at an early stage of development.
Capacity for mitigation of climate change and adaptation to its
impacts is limited by the availability and economic viability of
appropriate technologies and robust collaborative processes for
decision making among multiple stakeholders and management
criteria. Knowledge of the costs and benefits (including
avoided damages) of specific options is scarce. Management
strategies that adapt as the climate changes require an adequate
observational network to inform them. There is limited
understanding of the legal and institutional frameworks and
demand-side statistics necessary for mainstreaming adaptation
into development plans to reduce water-related vulnerabilities,
and of appropriate channels for financial flows into the water
sector for adaptation investment.
This section notes a number of key gaps in knowledge related
to these needs.
calculated from parameters such as solar radiation, relative
humidity and wind speed. Records are often very short, and
available for only a few regions, which impedes complete
analysis of changes in droughts. [WGI 3.3.3, 3.3.4]
• There may be opportunities for river flow data rescue
in some regions. Where no observations are available,
the construction of new observing networks should be
considered. [WGI 3.3.4]
• Groundwater is not well monitored, and the processes of
groundwater depletion and recharge are not well modelled
in many regions. [WGI 3.3.4]
• Monitoring data are needed on water quality, water use and
sediment transport.
• Snow, ice and frozen ground inventories are incomplete.
Monitoring of changes is unevenly distributed in both space
and time. There is a general lack of data from the Southern
Hemisphere. [WGI TS 6.2, 4.2.2, 4.3]
• More information is needed on plant evapotranspiration
responses to the combined effects of rising atmospheric
CO2, rising temperature and rising atmospheric water vapour
concentration, in order to better understand the relationship
between the direct effects of atmospheric CO2 enrichment
and changes in the hydrological cycle. [WGI 7.2]
• Quality assurance, homogenisation of data sets, and intercalibration
of methods and procedures could be important
whenever different agencies, countries etc., maintain
monitoring within one region or catchment.
Better observational data and data access are necessary
to improve understanding of ongoing changes, to better
constrain model projections, and are a prerequisite for adaptive
management required under conditions of climate change.
Progress in knowledge depends on improved data availability.
Shrinkage of some observational networks is occurring.
Relatively short records may not reveal the full extent of
natural variability and confound detection studies, while longterm
reconstruction can place recent trends and extremes in a
broader context. Major gaps in observations of climate change
related to freshwater and hydrological cycles were identified as
follows [WGI TS.6; WGII 3.8]:
• Difficulties in the measurement of precipitation remain an
area of concern in quantifying global and regional trends.
Precipitation measurements over oceans (from satellites)
are still in the development phase. There is a need to ensure
ongoing satellite monitoring, and the development of
reliable statistics for inferred precipitation. [WGI 3.3.2.5]
• Many hydrometeorological variables e.g., streamflow, soil
moisture and actual evapotranspiration, are inadequately
measured. Potential evapotranspiration is generally
8.2.1 Understanding and projecting climate
change
Major uncertainties in understanding and modelling changes in
climate relating to the hydrological cycle include the following
[SYR; WGI TS.6]:
• Changes in a number of radiative drivers of climate are not
fully quantified and understood (e.g., aerosols and their
effects on cloud properties, methane, ozone, stratospheric
water vapour, land-use change, past solar variations).
• Confidence in attributing some observed climate change
phenomena to anthropogenic or natural processes is limited
by uncertainties in radiative forcing, as well as by uncertainty
in processes and observations. Attribution becomes more
difficult at smaller spatial and temporal scales, and there
is less confidence in understanding precipitation changes
than there is for temperature. There are very few attribution
studies for changes in extreme events.
• Uncertainty in modelling some modes of climate variability,
and of the distribution of precipitation between heavy and
light events, remains large. In many regions, projections of
changes in mean precipitation also vary widely between
models, even in the sign of the change. It is necessary to
improve understanding of the sources of uncertainty.
• In many regions where fine spatial scales in climate are
8.2 Understanding climate projections
iiiiiiiand their impacts
136
Gaps in knowledge and suggestions for further work Section 8
generated by topography, there is insufficient information
on how climate change will be expressed at these scales.
• Climate models remain limited by the spatial resolution and
ensemble size that can be achieved with present computer
resources, by the need to include some additional processes,
and by large uncertainties in the modelling of certain
feedbacks (e.g., from clouds and the carbon cycle).
• Limited knowledge of ice sheet and ice shelf processes
leads to unquantified uncertainties in projections of future
ice sheet mass balance, leading in turn to uncertainty in sealevel
rise projections.
8.2.2 Water-related impacts [WGII 3.5.1, 3.8]
• Because of the uncertainties involved, probabilistic
approaches are required to enable water managers
to undertake analyses of risk under climate change.
Techniques are being developed to construct probability
distributions of specified outcomes. Further development
of this research, and of techniques to communicate the
results, as well as their application to the user community,
are required.
• Further work on detection and attribution of present-day
hydrological changes is required; in particular, changes in
water resources and in the occurrence of extreme events.
As part of this effort, the development of indicators of
climate change impacts on freshwater, and operational
systems to monitor them, are required.
• There remains a scale mismatch between the large-scale
climatic models and the catchment scale – the most
important scale for water management. Higher-resolution
climate models, with better land-surface properties and
interactions, are therefore required to obtain information
of more relevance to water management. Statistical and
physical downscaling can contribute.
• Most of the impact studies of climate change on water
stress in countries assess demand and supply on an annual
basis. Analysis at the monthly or higher temporal resolution
scale is desirable, since changes in seasonal patterns and
the probability of extreme events may offset the positive
effect of increased availability of water resources.
• The impact of climate change on snow, ice and frozen
ground as sensitive storage variables in the water cycle is
highly non-linear and more physically- and process-oriented
modelling, as well as specific atmospheric downscaling, is
required. There is a lack of detailed knowledge of runoff
changes as caused by changing glaciers, snow cover, rain–
snow transition, and frozen ground in different climate
regions.
• Methods need to be improved that allow the assessment of
the impacts of changing climate variability on freshwater
resources. In particular, there is a need to develop localscale
data sets and simple climate-linked computerised
watershed models that would allow water managers
to assess impacts and to evaluate the functioning and
resilience of their systems, given the range of uncertainty
surrounding future climate projections.
• Feedbacks between land use and climate change (including
vegetation change and anthropogenic activity such as
irrigation and reservoir construction) should be analysed
more extensively; e.g., by coupled climate and land-use
modelling.
• Improved assessment of the water-related consequences
of different climate policies and development pathways is
needed.
• Climate change impacts on water quality are poorly
understood for both developing and developed countries,
particularly with respect to the impact of extreme events.
• Relatively few results are available on the socio-economic
aspects of climate change impacts related to water resources,
including climate change impacts on water demand.
• Impacts of climate change on aquatic ecosystems (not only
temperatures, but also altered flow regimes, water levels
and ice cover) are not understood adequately.
• Despite its significance, groundwater has received little
attention in climate change impact assessment compared to
surface water resources.
8.3 Adaptation and mitigation
• Water resources management clearly impacts on many other
policy areas (e.g., energy projections, land use, food security
and nature conservation). Adequate tools are not available to
facilitate the appraisal of adaptation and mitigation options
across multiple water-dependent sectors, including the
adoption of water-efficient technologies and practices.
• In the absence of reliable projections of future changes in
hydrological variables, adaptation processes and methods
which can be usefully implemented in the absence of
accurate projections, such as improved water-use efficiency
and water-demand management, offer no-regrets options to
cope with climate change. [WGII 3.8]
Biodiversity. Identification of water resources needs for
maintaining environmental values and services, especially
related to deltaic ecosystems, wetlands and adequate
instream flows.
• Carbon capture and storage: Better understanding is needed
of leakage processes, because of potential degradation of
groundwater quality. This requires an enhanced ability to
monitor and verify the behaviour of geologically stored
CO2. [CCS, TS, Chapter 10]
• Hydropower/dam construction: An integrated approach
is needed, given the diversity of interests (flood control,
hydropower, irrigation, urban water supply, ecosystems,
fisheries and navigation), to arrive at sustainable solutions.
Methane emissions have to be estimated. Also, the net
effect on the carbon-budget in the affected region has to be
evaluated.
• Bio-energy: Insight is required into the water demand, and
its consequences, of large-scale plantations of commercial
bio-energy crops. [WGIII 4.3.3.3]
• Agriculture: Net effects of more effective irrigation on the
GHG budget need to be better understood (higher carbon

storage in soils through enhanced yields and residue returns
and its offset by CO2 emissions from energy systems to
deliver the water, or by N2O emissions from higher moisture
and fertiliser inputs). [WGIII 8.4.1.1]
• Forestry: Better understanding of the effects of
massive afforestation on the processes forming the
hydrological cycle, such as rainfall, evapotranspiration,
runoff, infiltration and groundwater recharge is needed.
[WGIII 9.7.3]
• Wastewater and water reuse: Greater insight is needed
into emissions from decentralised treatment processes and
uncontrolled wastewater discharges in developing countries.
The impact of properly reusing water on mitigation and
adaptation strategies needs to be understood and quantified.

Appendix II: Glossary
167
A.
Abrupt climate change
The nonlinearity of the climate system may lead to abrupt
climate change, sometimes called rapid climate change, abrupt
events or even surprises. The term abrupt often refers to time
scales faster than the typical time scale of the responsible
forcing. However, not all abrupt climate changes need be
externally forced. Some possible abrupt events that have been
proposed include a dramatic reorganisation of the thermohaline
circulation, rapid deglaciation and massive melting of permafrost
or increases in soil respiration leading to fast changes in the
carbon cycle. Others may be truly unexpected, resulting from a
strong, rapidly changing, forcing of a non-linear system.
Active layer
The layer of ground that is subject to annual thawing and
freezing in areas underlain by permafrost.
Adaptation
Initiatives and measures to reduce the vulnerability of natural
and human systems against actual or expected climate change
effects. Various types of adaptation exist, e.g., anticipatory and
reactive, private and public, and autonomous and planned.
Examples are raising river or coastal dikes, the substitution of
more temperature-shock resistant plants for sensitive ones, etc.
Adaptive capacity
The whole of capabilities, resources and institutions of a country
or region to implement effective adaptation measures.
Aerosols
A collection of airborne solid or liquid particles, with a typical
size between 0.01 and 10 micrometre (a millionth of a metre)
that reside in the atmosphere for at least several hours. Aerosols
may be of either natural or anthropogenic origin. Aerosols may
influence climate in several ways: directly through scattering
and absorbing radiation, and indirectly through acting as cloud
condensation nuclei or modifying the optical properties and
lifetime of clouds.
Afforestation
Planting of new forests on lands that historically have not
contained forests (for at least 50 years). For a discussion of the
term forest and related terms such as afforestation, reforestation,
and deforestation see the IPCC Report on Land Use, Land-Use
Change and Forestry (IPCC, 2000).
Albedo
The fraction of solar radiation reflected by a surface or object,
often expressed as a percentage. Snow-covered surfaces have a
high albedo, the surface albedo of soils ranges from high to low,
and vegetation-covered surfaces and oceans have a low albedo.
The Earth’s planetary albedo varies mainly through varying
cloudiness, snow, ice, leaf area and land cover changes.
Algal bloom
A reproductive explosion of algae in a lake, river, or ocean.
Alpine
The biogeographic zone made up of slopes above the tree line,
characterised by the presence of rosette-forming herbaceous
plants and low shrubby slow-growing woody plants.
Annex I countries
The group of countries included in Annex I (as amended in
1998) to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate
Change (UNFCCC), including all the OECD countries in the
year 1990 and countries with economies in transition. Under
Articles 4.2 (a) and 4.2 (b) of the Convention, Annex I countries
committed themselves specifically to the aim of returning
individually or jointly to their 1990 levels of greenhouse gas
emissions by the year 2000. By default, the other countries are
referred to as non-Annex I countries.

168
Appendix II: Glossary
Annex II countries
The group of countries included in Annex II to the United Nations
Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC),
including all OECD countries in the year 1990. Under Article
4.2 (g) of the Convention, these countries are expected to
provide financial resources to assist developing countries
to comply with their obligations, such as preparing national
reports. Annex II countries are also expected to promote the
transfer of environmentally sound technologies to developing
countries.
Annex B countries
The countries included in Annex B to the Kyoto Protocol that
have agreed to a target for their greenhouse-gas emissions,
including all the Annex I countries (as amended in 1998) except
for Turkey and Belarus. See Kyoto Protocol
Annular modes
Preferred patterns of change in atmospheric circulation
corresponding to changes in the zonally averaged mid-latitude
westerlies. The Northern Annular Mode has a bias to the North
Atlantic and has a large correlation with the North Atlantic
Oscillation. The Southern Annular Mode occurs in the Southern
Hemisphere. The variability of the mid-latitude westerlies has
also been known as zonal flow (or wind) vacillation, and defined
through a zonal index. [WGI Box 3.4]
Anthropogenic
Resulting from or produced by human beings.
Aquaculture
The managed cultivation of aquatic plants or animals such
as salmon or shellfish held in captivity for the purpose of
harvesting.
Aquifer
A stratum of permeable rock that bears water. An unconfined
aquifer is recharged directly by local rainfall, rivers and lakes,
and the rate of recharge will be influenced by the permeability
of the overlying rocks and soils.
Arid region
A land region of low rainfall, where low is widely accepted to
be less than 250 mm precipitation per year.
Atlantic Multi-decadal Oscillation (AMO)
A multi-decadal (65 to 75 year) fluctuation in the North Atlantic,
in which sea surface temperatures showed warm phases during
roughly 1860 to 1880 and 1930 to 1960 and cool phases during
1905 to 1925 and 1970 to 1990 with a range of order 0.4o C.
Atmosphere
The gaseous envelope surrounding the Earth. The dry atmosphere
consists almost entirely of nitrogen (78.1% volume mixing
ratio) and oxygen (20.9% volume mixing ratio), together with
a number of trace gases, such as argon (0.93% volume mixing
ratio), helium and radiatively active greenhouse gases such as
carbon dioxide (0.035% volume mixing ratio) and ozone. In
addition, the atmosphere contains the greenhouse gas water
vapour, whose amounts are highly variable but typically around
1% volume mixing ratio. The atmosphere also contains clouds
and aerosols.
Atmospheric boundary layer
The atmospheric layer adjacent to the Earth’s surface that is
affected by friction against that boundary surface, and possibly
by transport of heat and other variables across that surface
(AMS, 2000). The lowest 10 metres or so of the boundary
layer, where mechanical generation of turbulence is dominant,
is called the surface boundary layer or surface layer.
Attribution
See Detection and attribution.
B.
Barrier
Any obstacle to reaching a goal, adaptation or mitigation
potential that can be overcome or attenuated by a policy,
programme, or measure. Barrier removal includes correcting
market failures directly or reducing the transactions costs in
the public and private sectors by e.g., improving institutional
capacity, reducing risk and uncertainty, facilitating market
transactions, and enforcing regulatory policies.
Baseline

recently dead plant material is often included as dead biomass.
The quantity of biomass is expressed as a dry weight or as the
energy, carbon, or nitrogen content.
Biome
A major and distinct regional element of the biosphere,
typically consisting of several ecosystems (e.g., forests, rivers,
ponds, swamps within a region of similar climate). Biomes are
characterised by typical communities of plants and animals.
169
Appendix II: Glossary
Biosphere (terrestrial and marine)
The part of the Earth system comprising all ecosystems and
living organisms, in the atmosphere, on land (terrestrial
biosphere) or in the oceans (marine biosphere), including
derived dead organic matter, such as litter, soil organic matter
and oceanic detritus.
Biota
All living organisms of an area; the flora and fauna considered
as a unit.

C.
C3 plants
Plants that produce a three-carbon compound during
photosynthesis, including most trees and agricultural crops such
as rice, wheat, soybeans, potatoes and vegetables.
C4 plants
Plants, mainly of tropical origin, that produce a four-carbon
compound during photosynthesis, including many grasses and
the agriculturally important crops maize, sugar cane, millet and
sorghum.
Carbon (dioxide) capture and storage (CCS)
A process consisting of separation of carbon dioxide from
industrial and energy-related sources, transport to a storage
location, and long-term isolation from the atmosphere.
Carbon cycle
The term used to describe the flow of carbon (in various
forms, e.g., as carbon dioxide) through the atmosphere, ocean,
terrestrial biosphere and lithosphere.
Carbon dioxide (CO2)
A naturally occurring gas, also a by-product of burning fossil
fuels from fossil carbon deposits, such as oil, gas and coal, of
burning biomass and of land use changes and other industrial
processes. It is the principal anthropogenic greenhouse gas
that affects the Earth’s radiative balance. It is the reference
gas against which other greenhouse gases are measured and
therefore has a Global Warming Potential of 1.
Carbon dioxide (CO2) enrichment
See Carbon dioxide (CO2) fertilisation.
Carbon dioxide (CO2) fertilisation
The enhancement of the growth of plants as a result of increased
atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) concentration. Depending on
their mechanism of photosynthesis, certain types of plants are
more sensitive to changes in atmospheric CO2 concentration.
Carbon sequestration
The uptake of carbon containing substances, in particular
carbon dioxide. See Sequestration.
Catchment
An area that collects and drains rainwater.
Cholera
A water-borne intestinal infection caused by a bacterium (Vibrio
cholerae) that results in frequent watery stools, cramping
abdominal pain, and eventual collapse from dehydration and
shock.
Clean Development Mechanism (CDM)
Defined in Article 12 of the Kyoto Protocol, the CDM is intended
to meet two objectives: (1) to assist parties not included in Annex
I in achieving sustainable development and in contributing
to the ultimate objective of the Convention; and (2) to assist
parties included in Annex I in achieving compliance with their
quantified emission limitation and reduction commitments.
Certified Emission Reduction Units from CDM projects
undertaken in non-Annex I countries that limit or reduce
greenhouse gas emissions, when certified by operational entities
designated by Conference of the Parties/Meeting of the Parties,
can be accrued to the investor (government or industry) from
parties in Annex B. A share of the proceeds from the certified
project activities is used to cover administrative expenses as
well as to assist developing country parties that are particularly
vulnerable to the adverse effects of climate change to meet the
costs of adaptation.
Climate
Climate in a narrow sense is usually defined as the average
weather, or more rigorously, as the statistical description in
terms of the mean and variability of relevant quantities over a
period of time ranging from months to thousands or millions
of years. The classical period for averaging these variables is
30 years, as defined by the World Meteorological Organization.
The relevant quantities are most often surface variables such as
temperature, precipitation and wind. Climate in a wider sense
is the state, including a statistical description, of the climate
system.
Climate change
Climate change refers to a change in the state of the climate that
can be identified (e.g., by using statistical tests) by changes in the
mean and/or the variability of its properties, and that persists for
170
Appendix II: Glossary
an extended period, typically decades or longer. Climate change
may be due to natural internal processes or external forcings,
or to persistent anthropogenic changes in the composition of
the atmosphere or in land use. Note that the United Nations
Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), in
its Article 1, defines climate change as: ‘a change of climate
which is attributed directly or indirectly to human activity that
alters the composition of the global atmosphere and which is in
addition to natural climate variability observed over comparable
time periods’. The UNFCCC thus makes a distinction between
climate change attributable to human activities altering the
atmospheric composition, and climate variability attributable
to natural causes. See also Climate variability; Detection and
attribution.
Climate feedback
An interaction mechanism between processes in the climate
system is called a climate feedback when the result of an
initial process triggers changes in a second process that in turn
influences the initial one. A positive feedback intensifies the
original process, and a negative feedback reduces it.
Climate model
A numerical representation of the climate system based on the
physical, chemical and biological properties of its components,
their interactions and feedback processes, and accounting for
all or some of its known properties. The climate system can be
represented by models of varying complexity, that is, for any
one component or combination of components a spectrum or
hierarchy of models can be identified, differing in such aspects as
the number of spatial dimensions, the extent to which physical,
chemical or biological processes are explicitly represented, or
the level at which empirical parameterisations are involved.
Coupled atmosphere-ocean general circulation models
(AOGCMs) provide a representation of the climate system that
is near the most comprehensive end of the spectrum currently
available. There is an evolution towards more complex models
with interactive chemistry and biology (see WGI Chapter 8).
Climate models are applied as a research tool to study and
simulate the climate, and for operational purposes, including
monthly, seasonal and interannual climate predictions.
Climate projection
A projection of the response of the climate system to emissions
or concentration scenarios of greenhouse gases and aerosols,
or radiative forcing scenarios, often based upon simulations
by climate models. Climate projections are distinguished from
climate predictions in order to emphasise that climate projections
depend upon the emission/concentration/radiative forcing
scenario used, which are based on assumptions concerning, for
example, future socioeconomic and technological developments
that may or may not be realised and are therefore subject to
substantial uncertainty.
Climate scenario
A plausible and often simplified representation of the future
climate, based on an internally consistent set of climatological
relationships that has been constructed for explicit use in
investigating the potential consequences of anthropogenic
climate change, often serving as input to impact models.
Climate projections often serve as the raw material for
constructing climate scenarios, but climate scenarios usually
require additional information such as about the observed
current climate. A climate change scenario is the difference
between a climate scenario and the current climate.
Climate system
The climate system is the highly complex system consisting
of five major components: the atmosphere, the hydrosphere,
the cryosphere, the land surface and the biosphere, and the
interactions between them. The climate system evolves in time
under the influence of its own internal dynamics and because
of external forcings such as volcanic eruptions, solar variations
and anthropogenic forcings such as the changing composition
of the atmosphere and land-use change.
Climate variability
Climate variability refers to variations in the mean state and
other statistics (such as standard deviations, the occurrence of
extremes, etc.) of the climate on all spatial and temporal scales
beyond that of individual weather events. Variability may be due
to natural internal processes within the climate system (internal
variability), or to variations in natural or anthropogenic external
forcing (external variability). See also Climate change.
CO2 See Carbon dioxide.
CO2-fertilisation
See Carbon dioxide fertilisation.
Confidence
The level of confidence in the correctness of a result is expressed
in this Technical Paper using a standard terminology defined in
Box 1.1. See also Likelihood; Uncertainty.
Control run
A model run carried out to provide a baseline for comparison
with climate-change experiments. The control run uses constant
values for the radiative forcing due to greenhouse gases,
appropriate to present-day or pre-industrial conditions.
Coral
The term coral has several meanings, but is usually the common
name for the Order Scleractinia, all members of which have hard
limestone skeletons, and which are divided into reef-building and
non-reef-building, or cold- and warm-water corals. See Coral reefs
Coral reefs
Rock-like limestone structures built by corals along ocean
coasts (fringing reefs) or on top of shallow, submerged banks or
shelves (barrier reefs, atolls), most conspicuous in tropical and
subtropical oceans.
Cost
The consumption of resources such as labour time, capital,
171
Appendix II: Glossary
materials, fuels, etc. as a consequence of an action. In economics
all resources are valued at their opportunity cost, being the value
of the most valuable alternative use of the resources. Costs are
defined in a variety of ways and under a variety of assumptions
that affect their value. Cost types include: administrative costs,
damage costs (to ecosystems, people and economies due to
negative effects from climate change), and implementation costs
of changing existing rules and regulation, capacity building
efforts, information, training and education, etc. Private costs
are carried by individuals, companies or other private entities
that undertake the action, whereas social costs include also the
external costs on the environment and on society as a whole.
The negative of costs are benefits (also sometimes called
negative costs). Costs minus benefits are net costs.
Cryosphere
The component of the climate system consisting of all snow, ice
and frozen ground (including permafrost) on and beneath the
surface of the Earth and ocean. See also Glacier; Ice sheet.
D.
Deforestation
Conversion of forest to non-forest. For a discussion of the term
forest and related terms such as afforestation, reforestation,
and deforestation see the IPCC Report on Land Use, Land-Use
Change and Forestry (IPCC, 2000).
Dengue fever
An infectious viral disease spread by mosquitoes, often called
breakbone fever because it is characterised by severe pain in the
joints and back. Subsequent infections of the virus may lead to
dengue haemorrhagic fever (DHF) and dengue shock syndrome
(DSS), which may be fatal.
Desert
A region of very low rainfall, where ‘very low’ is widely
accepted to be less than 100 mm per year.
Desertification
Land degradation in arid, semi-arid and dry sub-humid areas
resulting from various factors, including climatic variations and
human activities. Further, the United Nations Convention to
Combat Desertification (UNCCD) defines land degradation as
a reduction or loss in arid, semi-arid, and dry sub-humid areas
of the biological or economic productivity and complexity of
rain-fed cropland, irrigated cropland, or range, pasture, forest
and woodlands resulting from land uses or from a process or
combination of processes, including those arising from human
activities and habitation patterns, such as: (i) soil erosion
caused by wind and/or water; (ii) deterioration of the physical,
chemical, and biological or economic properties of soil; and
(iii) long-term loss of natural vegetation.
Detection and attribution
Climate varies continually on all time scales. Detection of
climate change is the process of demonstrating that climate has
changed in some defined statistical sense, without providing a
reason for that change. Attribution of causes of climate change
is the process of establishing the most likely causes for the
detected change with some defined level of confidence.
Development path or pathway
An evolution based on an array of technological, economic,
social, institutional, cultural, and biophysical characteristics that
determine the interactions between natural and human systems,
including production and consumption patterns in all countries,
over time at a particular scale. Alternative development paths
refer to different possible trajectories of development, the
continuation of current trends being just one of the many
paths.
Disturbance regime
Frequency, intensity, and types of disturbances, such as fires,
insect or pest outbreaks, floods and droughts.
Downscaling
Downscaling is a method that derives local-to-regional-scale
(10 to 100km) information from larger-scale models or data
analyses. Two main methods are distinguished: dynamical
downscaling and empirical/statistical downscaling. The
dynamical method uses the output of regional climate models,
global models with variable spatial resolution or high-resolution
global models. The empirical/statistical methods develop
statistical relationships that link the large-scale atmospheric
variables with local/regional climate variables. In all cases, the
quality of the downscaled product depends on the quality of the
driving model.
Drought
In general terms, drought is a ‘prolonged absence or marked
deficiency of precipitation’, a ‘deficiency that results in water
shortage for some activity or for some group’, or a ‘period of
abnormally dry weather sufficiently prolonged for the lack
of precipitation to cause a serious hydrological imbalance’
(Heim, 2002). Drought has been defined in a number of
ways. Agricultural drought relates to moisture deficits in
the topmost 1 metre or so of soil (the root zone) that affect
crops, meteorological drought is mainly a prolonged deficit of
precipitation, and hydrologic drought is related to below-normal
streamflow, lake and groundwater levels. A megadrought is a
longdrawn out and pervasive drought, lasting much longer than
normal, usually a decade or more.
Dyke
A human-made wall or embankment along a shore to prevent
flooding of low-lying land.
Dynamic global vegetation model (DGVM)
Models that simulate vegetation development and dynamics
through space and time, as driven by climate and other
environmental changes.
Dynamical ice discharge
Discharge of ice from ice sheets or ice caps caused by the dynamics
of the ice sheet or ice cap (e.g., in the form of glacier flow, ice
streams and calving icebergs) rather than by melt or runoff.
172

E.
Ecological community
A community of plants and animals characterised by a
typical assemblage of species and their abundances. See also
Ecosystem.
Ecosystem
A system of living organisms interacting with each other and their
physical environment. The boundaries of what could be called
an ecosystem are somewhat arbitrary, depending on the focus of
interest or study. Thus, the extent of an ecosystem may range
from very small spatial scales to, ultimately, the entire Earth.
El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO)
The term El Niño was initially used to describe a warm-water
current that periodically flows along the coast of Ecuador and
Perú, disrupting the local fishery. It has since become identified
with a basinwide warming of the tropical Pacific east of the
dateline. This oceanic event is associated with a fluctuation of
a global-scale tropical and subtropical surface pressure pattern
called the Southern Oscillation. This coupled atmosphere-ocean
phenomenon, with preferred time scales of two to about seven
years, is collectively known as El Niño-Southern Oscillation,
or ENSO. It is often measured by the surface pressure anomaly
difference between Darwin and Tahiti and the sea surface
temperatures in the central and eastern equatorial Pacific.
During an ENSO event, the prevailing trade winds weaken,
reducing upwelling and altering ocean currents such that the
sea surface temperatures warm, further weakening the trade
winds. This event has a great impact on the wind, sea surface
temperature and precipitation patterns in the tropical Pacific. It
has climatic effects throughout the Pacific region and in many
other parts of the world, through global teleconnections. The
cold phase of ENSO is called La Niña.
Emissions scenario
A plausible representation of the future development of
emissions of substances that are potentially radiatively active
(e.g., greenhouse gases, aerosols), based on a coherent and
internally consistent set of assumptions about driving forces
(such as demographic and socioeconomic development,
technological change) and their key relationships. Concentration
scenarios, derived from emission scenarios, are used as input
to a climate model to compute climate projections. See SRES
scenarios.
Endemic
Restricted or peculiar to a locality or region. With regard to
human health, endemic can refer to a disease or agent present
or usually prevalent in a population or geographical area at all
times.
Energy
The amount of work or heat delivered. Energy is classified in
a variety of types and becomes useful to human ends when it
flows from one place to another or is converted from one type
into another. Primary energy (also referred to as energy sources)
is the energy embodied in natural resources (e.g., coal, crude oil,
natural gas, uranium) that has not undergone any anthropogenic
conversion. This primary energy needs to be converted and
transported to become usable energy (e.g., light). Renewable
energy is obtained from the continuing or repetitive currents of
energy occurring in the natural environment, and includes noncarbon
technologies such as solar energy, hydropower, wind,
tide and waves, and geothermal heat, as well as carbon neutral
technologies such as biomass. Embodied energy is the energy
used to produce a material substance (such as processed metals,
or building materials), taking into account energy used at the
manufacturing facility (zero order), energy used in producing
the materials that are used in the manufacturing facility (first
order), and so on.
Ensemble
A group of parallel model simulations used for climate
projections. Variation of the results across the ensemble members
gives an estimate of uncertainty. Ensembles made with the
same model but different initial conditions only characterise the
uncertainty associated with internal climate variability, whereas
multi-model ensembles including simulations by several
models also include the impact of model differences. Perturbedparameter
ensembles, in which model parameters are varied in
a systematic manner, aim to produce a more objective estimate
of modelling uncertainty than is possible with traditional multimodel
ensembles.
Epidemic
Occurring suddenly in incidence rates clearly in excess of
normal expectancy, applied especially to infectious diseases
but may also refer to any disease, injury, or other health-related
event occurring in such outbreaks.
Equilibrium line
The boundary between the region on a glacier where there is a
net annual loss of ice mass (ablation area) and that where there
is a net annual gain (accumulation area). The altitude of this
boundary is referred to as equilibrium line altitude.
Erosion
The process of removal and transport of soil and rock by
weathering, mass wasting, and the action of streams, glaciers,
waves, winds, and underground water.
Eutrophication
The process by which a body of water (often shallow) becomes
(either naturally or by pollution) rich in dissolved nutrients,
with a seasonal deficiency in dissolved oxygen.
Evaporation
The transition process from liquid to gaseous state.
Evapotranspiration
The combined process of water evaporation from the Earth’s
surface and transpiration from vegetation.
External forcing
External forcing refers to a forcing agent outside the climate
173
Appendix II: Glossary
system causing a change in the climate system. Volcanic
eruptions, solar variations and anthropogenic changes in
the composition of the atmosphere and land-use change are
external forcings.
Extinction
The complete disappearance of an entire biological species.
Extirpation
The disappearance of a species from part of its range; local
extinction.
Extreme weather event
An event that is rare at a particular place and time of year.
Definitions of “rare” vary, but an extreme weather event would
normally be as rare as or rarer than the 10th or 90th percentile
of the observed probability density function. By definition,
the characteristics of what is called extreme weather may vary
from place to place in an absolute sense. Single extreme events
cannot be simply and directly attributed to anthropogenic
climate change, as there is always a finite chance the event
in question might have occurred naturally. When a pattern of
extreme weather persists for some time, such as a season, it may
be classed as an extreme climate event, especially if it yields an
average or total that is itself extreme (e.g., drought or heavy
rainfall over a season).
F.
Feedback
See Climate feedback.
Food chain
The chain of trophic relationships formed if several species
feed on each other. See Food web.
Food security
A situation that exists when people have secure access to
sufficient amounts of safe and nutritious food for normal growth,
development and an active and healthy life. Food insecurity may
be caused by the unavailability of food, insufficient purchasing
power, inappropriate distribution, or inadequate use of food at
the household level.
Food web
The network of trophic relationships within an ecological
community involving several interconnected food chains.
Forcing
See External forcing.
Forest
A vegetation type dominated by trees. Many definitions of the term
forest are in use throughout the world, reflecting wide differences
in biogeophysical conditions, social structure, and economics.
Particular criteria apply under the Kyoto Protocol. For a discussion of
the term forest and related terms such as afforestation, reforestation,
and deforestation see the IPCC Special Report on Land Use, Land-
Use Change, and Forestry (IPCC, 2000).
Fossil fuels
Carbon-based fuels from fossil hydrocarbon deposits, including
coal, peat, oil, and natural gas.
Framework Convention on Climate Change
See United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change
(UNFCCC).
Freshwater lens
A lenticular fresh groundwater body that underlies an oceanic
island. It is underlain by saline water.

G.
General circulation model
See Climate model.
Glacial lake
A lake formed by glacier meltwater, located either at the front
of a glacier (known as a proglacial lake), on the surface of a
glacier (supraglacial lake), within the glacier (englacial lake)
or at the glacier bed (subglacial lake).
Glacier
A mass of land ice which flows downhill under gravity (through
internal deformation and/or sliding at the base) and is constrained
by internal stress and friction at the base and sides. A glacier is
maintained by accumulation of snow at high altitudes, balanced
by melting at low altitudes or discharge into the sea. See Mass
balance.
Global warming
Global warming refers to the gradual increase, observed or
projected, in global average surface temperature, as one of the
consequences of radiative forcing caused by anthropogenic
emissions.
Globalisation
The growing integration and interdependence of countries
worldwide through the increasing volume and variety of crossborder
transactions in goods and services, free international
capital flows, and the more rapid and widespread diffusion of
technology, information and culture.
Governance
The way government is understood has changed in response
to social, economic and technological changes over recent
decades. There is a corresponding shift from government
defined strictly by the nation-state to a more inclusive concept
of governance, recognising the contributions of various levels
of government (global, international, regional, local) and the
roles of the private sector, of non-governmental actors and of
civil society.

Appendix II: Glossary
Greenhouse effect
Greenhouse gases effectively absorb thermal infrared radiation,
emitted by the Earth’s surface, by the atmosphere itself due to
the same gases, and by clouds. Atmospheric radiation is emitted
to all sides, including downward to the Earth’s surface. Thus
greenhouse gases trap heat within the surface-troposphere
system. This is called the greenhouse effect. Thermal infrared
radiation in the troposphere is strongly coupled to the temperature
of the atmosphere at the altitude at which it is emitted. In the
troposphere, the temperature generally decreases with height.
Effectively, infrared radiation emitted to space originates from
an altitude with a temperature of, on average, –19°C, in balance
with the net incoming solar radiation, whereas the Earth’s
surface is kept at a much higher temperature of, on average,
+14°C. An increase in the concentration of greenhouse gases
leads to an increased infrared opacity of the atmosphere, and
therefore to an effective radiation into space from a higher
altitude at a lower temperature. This causes a radiative forcing
that leads to an enhancement of the greenhouse effect, the socalled
enhanced greenhouse effect.
Greenhouse gas (GHG)
Greenhouse gases are those gaseous constituents of the
atmosphere, both natural and anthropogenic, that absorb and
emit radiation at specific wavelengths within the spectrum of
thermal infrared radiation emitted by the Earth’s surface, the
atmosphere itself, and by clouds. This property causes the
greenhouse effect. Water vapour (H2O), carbon dioxide (CO2),
nitrous oxide (N2O), methane (CH4) and ozone (O3) are the
primary greenhouse gases in the Earth’s atmosphere. Moreover,
there are a number of entirely human-made greenhouse gases in
the atmosphere, such as the halocarbons and other chlorine and
bromine containing substances, dealt with under the Montreal
Protocol. Beside CO2, N2O and CH4, the Kyoto Protocol
deals with the greenhouse gases sulphur hexafluoride (SF6),
hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs) and perfluorocarbons (PFCs).
Gross Domestic Product (GDP)
Gross Domestic Product (GDP) is the monetary value of all
goods and services produced within a nation.
Gross National Product (GNP)
Gross National Product (GNP) is the monetary value of all
goods and services produced by a nation’s economy, including
income generated abroad by domestic residents, but without
income generated by foreigners.
Gross primary production

saturation of an aquifer, either directly into a formation or
indirectly by way of another formation.
H.
Habitat

or group of closely associated organisms lives.
Hadley Circulation
A direct, thermally driven overturning cell in the atmosphere
consisting of poleward flow in the upper troposphere, subsiding

trade winds near the surface, and with rising air near the equator
and the so-called Inter-Tropical Convergence Zone.
Herbaceous

other than plants.
Holocene
The Holocene is a geological epoch extending from about
11,600 years ago to the present.
Human system
Any system in which human organisations play a major role.
Often, but not always, the term is synonymous with society
or social system e.g., agricultural system, political system,
technological system, economic system.
Hydrological cycle
The cycle in which water evaporates from the oceans and the
land surface, is carried over the Earth in atmospheric circulation
as water vapour, condensates to form clouds, precipitates again
as rain or snow, is intercepted by trees and vegetation, provides
runoff on the land surface, infiltrates into soils, recharges
groundwater, discharges into streams and, ultimately, flows out
into the oceans, from which it will eventually evaporate again
(AMS, 2000). The various systems involved in the hydrological
cycle are usually referred to as hydrological systems.
Hydrological systems
See Hydrological cycle.
Hydrosphere
The component of the climate system comprising liquid surface
and subterranean water, such as oceans, seas, rivers, fresh water
lakes, underground water, etc.
Hypolimnetic

of water that is stagnant and of essentially uniform temperature
except during the period of overturn.
I.
Ice cap
A dome shaped ice mass, usually covering a highland area,
which is considerably smaller in extent than an ice sheet.
Ice sheet
A mass of land ice that is sufficiently deep to cover most of
the underlying bedrock topography, so that its shape is mainly
175
Appendix II: Glossary
determined by its dynamics (the flow of the ice as it deforms
internally and/or slides at its base). An ice sheet flows outwards
from a high central ice plateau with a small average surface
slope. The margins usually slope more steeply, and most ice is
discharged through fast-flowing ice streams or outlet glaciers,
in some cases into the sea or into ice shelves floating on the
sea. There are only three large ice sheets in the modern world,
one on Greenland and two on Antarctica (the East and West
Antarctic ice sheets, divided by the Transantarctic Mountains).
During glacial periods there were others.
Ice shelf
A floating slab of ice of considerable thickness extending from
the coast (usually of great horizontal extent with a level or gently
sloping surface), often filling embayments in the coastline of
the ice sheets. Nearly all ice shelves are in Antarctica.
(Climate change) Impacts
The effects of climate change on natural and human systems.
Depending on the consideration of adaptation, one can
distinguish between potential impacts and residual impacts:
Potential impacts: all impacts that may occur given
a projected change in climate, without considering
adaptation.
Residual impacts: the impacts of climate change that would
occur after adaptation.
See also Market impacts and Non-market impacts.
Indigenous peoples
No internationally accepted definition of indigenous
peoples exists. Common characteristics often applied under
international law, and by United Nations agencies to distinguish
indigenous peoples include: residence within or attachment to
geographically distinct traditional habitats, ancestral territories,
and their natural resources; maintenance of cultural and social
identities, and social, economic, cultural and political institutions
separate from mainstream or dominant societies and cultures;
descent from population groups present in a given area, most
frequently before modern states or territories were created and
current borders defined; and self-identification as being part of
a distinct indigenous cultural group, and the desire to preserve
that cultural identity.
Indirect aerosol effect
Aerosols may lead to an indirect radiative forcing of the climate
system through acting as cloud condensation nuclei or modifying
the optical properties and lifetime of clouds. Two indirect effects
are distinguished:
Cloud albedo effect: A radiative forcing induced by an increase
in anthropogenic aerosols that cause an initial increase in droplet
concentration and a decrease in droplet size for fixed liquid
water content, leading to an increase in cloud albedo.
Cloud lifetime effect: A forcing induced by an increase in
anthropogenic aerosols that cause a decrease in droplet size,
reducing the precipitation efficiency, thereby modifying the
liquid water content, cloud thickness and cloud life time.
Apart from these indirect effects, aerosols may have a semidirect
effect. This refers to the absorption of solar radiation by
•
•
absorbing aerosol, which heats the air and tends to increase
the static stability relative to the surface. It may also cause
evaporation of cloud droplets.
Infectious disease
Any disease caused by microbial agents that can be transmitted
from one person to another or from animals to people. This may
occur by direct physical contact, by handling of an object that
has picked up infective organisms, through a disease carrier, via
contaminated water, or by spread of infected droplets coughed
or exhaled into the air.
Infrastructure
The basic equipment, utilities, productive enterprises,
installations, and services essential for the development,
operation, and growth of an organisation, city, or nation.
Integrated water resources management (IWRM)
The prevailing concept for water management which, however,
has not been defined unambiguously. IWRM is based on four
principles that were formulated by the International Conference
on Water and the Environment in Dublin, 1992: 1) fresh water
is a finite and vulnerable resource, essential to sustain life,
development and the environment; 2) water development and
management should be based on a participatory approach,
involving users, planners and policymakers at all levels; 3)
women play a central part in the provision, management and
safeguarding of water; 4) water has an economic value in all its
competing uses and should be recognised as an economic good.
Interdecadal Pacific Oscillation (IPO)
Also known as the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO). See North
Pacific Index. [For more detail see WGI Box 3.4]
Internal variability
See Climate variability.
Irrigation water-use efficiency
Irrigation water-use efficiency is the amount of biomass or seed
yield produced per unit irrigation water applied, typically about
1 tonne of dry matter per 100 mm water applied.
IS92 scenarios
See Emissions scenarios.
Isostacy
Isostacy refers to the way in which the lithosphere and mantle
respond visco-elastically to changes in surface loads. When
the loading of the lithosphere and/or the mantle is changed by
alterations in land ice mass, ocean mass, sedimentation, erosion
or mountain building, vertical isostatic adjustment results, in
order to balance the new load.
K.
Kyoto Protocol
The Kyoto Protocol to the United Nations Framework Convention
on Climate Change (UNFCCC) was adopted in 1997 in Kyoto,
Japan, at the Third Session of the Conference of the Parties (COP)
176
Appendix II: Glossary
to the UNFCCC. It contains legally binding commitments, in
addition to those included in the UNFCCC. Countries included
in Annex B of the Protocol (most Organization for Economic
Cooperation and Development countries and countries with
economies in transition) agreed to reduce their anthropogenic
greenhouse gas emissions (carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous
oxide, hydrofluorocarbons, perfluorocarbons, and sulphur
hexafluoride) by at least 5% below 1990 levels in the commitment
period 2008 to 2012. The Kyoto Protocol entered into force on 16
February 2005.
L.
La Niña
See El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO).
Land use and Land-use change
Land use refers to the total of arrangements, activities and inputs
undertaken in a certain land cover type (a set of human actions).
The term land use is also used in the sense of the social and
economic purposes for which land is managed (e.g., grazing,
timber extraction, and conservation).
Land-use change refers to a change in the use or management of
land by humans, which may lead to a change in land cover. Land
cover and land-use change may have an impact on the surface
albedo, evapotranspiration, sources and sinks of greenhouse
gases, or other properties of the climate system and may thus
have a radiative forcing and/or other impacts on climate, locally
or globally. See also: the IPCC Report on Land Use, Land-Use
Change, and Forestry (IPCC, 2000).

affect gross domestic product – e.g., changes in the price of
agricultural inputs and/or goods. See Non-market impacts.
Mass balance (of glaciers, ice caps or ice sheets)
The balance between the mass input to an ice body (accumulation)
and the mass loss (ablation, iceberg calving). Mass balance terms
include the following:
Specific mass balance: net mass loss or gain over a hydrological
cycle at a point on the surface of a glacier.
Total mass balance (of the glacier): the specific mass balance
spatially integrated over the entire glacier area; the total mass a
glacier gains or loses over a hydrological cycle.
Mean specific mass balance: the total mass balance per unit
area of the glacier. If surface is specified (specific surface mass
balance, etc.) then ice-flow contributions are not considered;
otherwise, mass balance includes contributions from ice flow and
iceberg calving. The specific surface mass balance is positive in
the accumulation area and negative in the ablation area.
Meningitis
Inflammation of the meninges (part of the covering of the brain),
usually caused by bacteria, viruses or fungi.
Meridional overturning circulation (MOC)
A zonally averaged, large scale meridional (north-south)
overturning circulation in the oceans. In the Atlantic such a
circulation transports relatively warm upper-ocean waters
northward, and relatively cold deep waters southward. The Gulf
Stream forms part of this Atlantic circulation.
Methane (CH4)
Methane is one of the six greenhouse gases to be mitigated
under the Kyoto Protocol and is the major component of
natural gas and associated with all hydrocarbon fuels, animal
husbandry and agriculture. Coal-bed methane is the gas found
in coal seams.

Millennium Summit in 2000.
Mires
Peat-accumulating wetlands. See Bog.
Mitigation
Technological change and substitution that reduce resource
inputs and emissions per unit of output. Although several
social, economic and technological policies would produce an
emissions reduction, with respect to climate change, mitigation
means implementing policies to reduce greenhouse gas
emissions and enhance sinks.
Monsoon
A monsoon is a tropical and subtropical seasonal reversal in
both the surface winds and associated precipitation, caused by
differential heating between a continental-scale land mass and
the adjacent ocean. Monsoon rains occur mainly over land in
summer.

upland slopes below the sub-alpine zone that is characterised
by the presence of mixed deciduous at lower and coniferous
evergreen forests at higher elevations.
Morbidity
Rate of occurrence of disease or other health disorder within
a population, taking account of the age-specific morbidity
rates. Morbidity indicators include chronic disease incidence/
prevalence, rates of hospitalisation, primary care consultations,
disability-days (i.e., days of absence from work), and prevalence
of symptoms.
Mortality
Rate of occurrence of death within a population; calculation of
mortality takes account of age-specific death rates, and can thus
yield measures of life expectancy and the extent of premature
death.
N.
Net ecosystem production (NEP)
Net ecosystem production is the difference between net primary
production (NPP) and heterotrophic respiration (mostly
decomposition of dead organic matter) of that ecosystem over
the same area.
Net primary production (NPP)
Net primary production is the gross primary production minus
autotrophic respiration, i.e., the sum of metabolic processes for
plant growth and maintenance, over the same area.
Nitrous oxide (N2O)
One of the six types of greenhouse gases to be curbed under
the Kyoto Protocol. The main anthropogenic source of nitrous
oxide is agriculture (soil and animal manure management),
but important contributions also come from sewage treatment,
combustion of fossil fuel, and chemical industrial processes.
Nitrous oxide is also produced naturally from a wide variety
of biological sources in soil and water, particularly microbial
action in wet tropical forests.
No-regrets policy
A policy that would generate net social and/or economic
benefits irrespective of whether or not anthropogenic climate
change occurs.
Non-Governmental Organisation (NGO)
A non-profit group or association organised outside of
institutionalised political structures to realise particular
social and/or environmental objectives or serve particular
constituencies.
Non-linearity
A process is called non-linear when there is no simple
proportional relation between cause and effect. The climate
system contains many such non-linear processes, resulting in a
system with a potentially very complex behaviour.
Non-market impacts
Impacts that affect ecosystems or human welfare, but that are
not easily expressed in monetary terms, e.g., an increased risk
of premature death, or increases in the number of people at risk
of hunger. See also Market impacts.
North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO)
The North Atlantic Oscillation consists of opposing variations of
barometric pressure near Iceland and near the Azores. It therefore
corresponds to fluctuations in the strength of the main westerly
winds across the Atlantic into Europe, and thus to fluctuations in
the embedded cyclones with their associated frontal systems. See
WGI Box 3.4.
North Pacific Index (NPI)
The NPI is the average mean sea level pressure anomaly in
the Aleutian Low over the Gulf of Alaska (30oN- 65oN, 160oE-
140oW). It is an index of the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (also
known as the Interdecadal Pacific Oscillation). See WGI Box
3.4 for further information.
O.
Oil sands and oil shale
Unconsolidated porous sands, sandstone rock and shales
containing bituminous material that can be mined and converted
to a liquid fuel.
Ombrotrophic bog
An acidic peat-accumulating wetland that is rainwater (instead
of groundwater) fed and thus particularly poor in nutrients.
Ozone (O3)
Ozone, the tri-atomic form of oxygen, is a gaseous atmospheric
constituent. In the troposphere, ozone is created both naturally
and by photochemical reactions involving gases resulting
from human activities (smog). Troposphere ozone acts as a
178
Appendix II: Glossary
greenhouse gas. In the stratosphere, ozone is created by the
interaction between solar ultraviolet radiation and molecular
oxygen (O2). Stratospheric ozone plays a dominant role in the
stratospheric radiative balance. Its concentration is highest in
the ozone layer.

An atmospheric large-scale wave pattern featuring a sequence
of tropospheric high- and low-pressure anomalies stretching
from the subtropical west Pacific to the east coast of North
America. [WGI Box 3.4]
Peat
Peat is formed from dead plants, typically Sphagnum mosses,
which are only partially decomposed due to their permanent
submergence in water and the presence of conserving substances
such as humic acids.
Peatland
Typically a wetland such as a mire slowly accumulating peat.
Percentile
A percentile is a value on a scale of zero to one hundred that
indicates the percentage of the data set values that is equal to or
below it. The percentile is often used to estimate the extremes
of a distribution. For example, the 90th (10th) percentile may be
used to refer to the threshold for the upper (lower) extremes.
Permafrost
Ground (soil or rock and included ice and organic material) that
remains at or below 0°C for at least two consecutive years. See
also Frozen ground.
pH
pH is a dimensionless measure of the acidity of water (or any
solution). Pure water has a pH=7. Acid solutions have a pH
smaller than 7 and basic solutions have a pH larger than 7. pH
is measured on a logarithmic scale. Thus, a pH decrease of 1
unit corresponds to a 10-fold increase in the acidity.
Phenology
The study of natural phenomena in biological systems that
recur periodically (e.g., development stages, migration) and
their relation to climate and seasonal changes.
Photosynthesis
The process by which green plants, algae and some bacteria take
carbon dioxide from the air (or bicarbonate in water) to build
carbohydrates. There are several pathways of photosynthesis
with different responses to atmospheric carbon dioxide
concentrations. See Carbon dioxide fertilisation.
Plankton
Micro-organisms living in the upper layers of aquatic systems.
A distinction is made between phytoplankton, which depend on
photosynthesis for their energy supply, and zooplankton, which
feed on phytoplankton.
Policies
In United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change
(UNFCCC) parlance, policies are taken and/or mandated by a
government—often in conjunction with business and industry
within its own country, or with other countries—to accelerate
mitigation and adaptation measures. Examples of policies
are carbon or other energy taxes, fuel efficiency standards for
automobiles, etc. Common and co-ordinated or harmonised
policies refer to those adopted jointly by parties.
Primary production
All forms of production accomplished by plants, also called
primary producers. See Gross primary production, Net primary
production and Net ecosystem production.
Projection
A potential future evolution of a quantity or set of quantities,
often computed with the aid of a model. Projections are
distinguished from predictions in order to emphasise that
projections involve assumptions concerning, for example,
future socioeconomic and technological developments that may
or may not be realised, and are therefore subject to substantial
uncertainty. See also Climate projection.
Proxy
A proxy climate indicator is a local record that is interpreted,
using physical and bio-physical principles, to represent some
combination of climate-related variations back in time. Climaterelated
data derived in this way are referred to as proxy data.
Examples of proxies include pollen analysis, tree-ring records,
characteristics of corals and various data derived from ice
cores.
R.
Radiative forcing
Radiative forcing is the change in the net, downward minus
upward, irradiance (expressed in Watts per square metre, W/m2)
at the tropopause due to a change in an external driver of climate
change, such as, for example, a change in the concentration
of carbon dioxide or the output of the Sun. Radiative forcing
is computed with all tropospheric properties held fixed at
their unperturbed values, and after allowing for stratospheric
temperatures, if perturbed, to readjust to radiative-dynamical
equilibrium. Radiative forcing is called instantaneous if no
change in stratospheric temperature is accounted for. For the
purposes of this Technical Paper, radiative forcing is further
defined as the change relative to the year 1750 and, unless
otherwise noted, refers to a global and annual average value.
Rangeland
Unmanaged grasslands, shrublands, savannas and tundra.
Reconstruction
The use of climate indicators to help determine (generally past)
climates.
179
Appendix II: Glossary
Reforestation
Planting of forests on lands that have previously contained forests
but that have been converted to some other use. For a discussion
of the term forest and related terms such as afforestation,
reforestation and deforestation, see the IPCC Report on Land
Use, Land-Use Change and Forestry (IPCC, 2000).
Regime
A regime is a preferred state of the climate system, often
representing one phase of dominant patterns or modes of
climate variability.
Region
A region is a territory characterised by specific geographical
and climatological features. The climate of a region is affected
by regional and local scale forcings such as topography, landuse
characteristics, lakes etc., as well as remote influences from
other regions.
Reservoir
An artificial or natural storage place for water, such as a lake,
pond or aquifer, from which the water may be withdrawn for
such purposes as irrigation or water supply.
Resilience
The ability of a social or ecological system to absorb disturbances
while retaining the same basic structure and ways of functioning,
the capacity for self-organisation, and the capacity to adapt to
stress and change.
Respiration
The process whereby living organisms convert organic matter
to carbon dioxide, releasing energy and consuming oxygen.
Riparian
Relating to or living or located on the bank of a natural
watercourse (such as a river) or sometimes of a lake or a
tidewater.
Runoff
That part of precipitation that does not evaporate and is not
transpired, but flows over the ground surface and returns to
bodies of water. See Hydrological cycle.
S.
Salinisation
The accumulation of salts in soils.
Saltwater intrusion
Displacement of fresh surface water or groundwater by the
advance of saltwater due to its greater density. This usually
occurs in coastal and estuarine areas due to reducing landbased
influence (e.g., either from reduced runoff and associated
groundwater recharge, or from excessive water withdrawals
from aquifers) or increasing marine influence (e.g., relative
sea-level rise).
Savanna
Tropical or sub-tropical grassland or woodland biomes with
scattered shrubs, individual trees or a very open canopy of
trees, all characterised by a dry (arid, semi-arid or semi-humid)
climate.
Scenario
A plausible and often simplified description of how the future
may develop, based on a coherent and internally consistent
set of assumptions about driving forces and key relationships.
Scenarios may be derived from projections, but are often based
on additional information from other sources, sometimes
combined with a narrative storyline. See also SRES scenarios;
Climate scenario; Emissions scenarios.
Sea ice
Any form of ice found at sea that has originated from the
freezing of sea water. Sea ice may be discontinuous pieces (ice
floes) moved on the ocean surface by wind and currents (pack
ice), or a motionless sheet attached to the coast (land-fast ice).
Sea-ice biome
The biome formed by all marine organisms living within or on
the floating sea ice (frozen seawater) of the polar oceans.
Sea-level change/sea-level rise
Sea level can change, both globally and locally, due to (i)
changes in the shape of the ocean basins, (ii) changes in the total
mass of water and (iii) changes in water density. Factors leading
to sea-level rise under global warming include both increases
in the total mass of water from the melting of land-based snow
and ice, and changes in water density from an increase in ocean
water temperatures and salinity changes. Relative sea-level rise
occurs where there is a local increase in the level of the ocean
relative to the land, which might be due to ocean rise and/or
land-level subsidence.
Sea-level equivalent (SLE)
The change in global average sea level that would occur if a
given amount of water or ice were added to or removed from
the oceans.
Sea surface temperature (SST)
The sea surface temperature is the subsurface bulk temperature
in the top few metres of the ocean, measured by ships, buoys
and drifters. From ships, measurements of water samples in
buckets were mostly switched in the 1940s to samples from
engine intake water. Satellite measurements of skin temperature
(uppermost layer; a fraction of a millimetre thick) in the infrared
or the top centimetre or so in the microwave are also used, but
must be adjusted to be compatible with the bulk temperature.
Seasonally frozen ground
See Frozen ground.
Semi-arid regions
Regions of moderately low rainfall, which are not highly
productive and are usually classified as rangelands. ‘Moderately
low’ is widely accepted as between 100 and 250 mm precipitation
per year. See also Arid region.
180
Appendix II: Glossary
Sensitivity
Sensitivity is the degree to which a system is affected, either
adversely or beneficially, by climate variability or climate
change. The effect may be direct (e.g., a change in crop yield
in response to a change in the mean, range, or variability of
temperature) or indirect (e.g., damages caused by an increase in
the frequency of coastal flooding due to sea-level rise).
Sequestration
Carbon storage in terrestrial or marine reservoirs. Biological
sequestration includes direct removal of CO2 from the
atmosphere through land-use change, afforestation,
reforestation, carbon storage in landfills and practices that
enhance soil carbon in agriculture.
Silviculture
Cultivation, development and care of forests.
Sink
Any process, activity or mechanism which removes a
greenhouse gas, an aerosol or a precursor of a greenhouse gas
or aerosol from the atmosphere.
Snow pack
A seasonal accumulation of slow-melting snow.
Snow water equivalent
The equivalent volume/mass of water that would be produced if
a particular body of snow or ice was melted.
Soil moisture
Water stored in or at the land surface and available for evaporation.
Source
Source mostly refers to any process, activity or mechanism
that releases a greenhouse gas, an aerosol, or a precursor of a
greenhouse gas or aerosol into the atmosphere. Source can also
refer to e.g., an energy source.
Southern Oscillation Index (SOI)
See El Niño-Southern Oscillation.
Spatial and temporal scales
Climate may vary on a large range of spatial and temporal scales.
Spatial scales may range from local (less than 100,000 km2),
through regional (100,000 to 10 million km2) to continental (10
to 100 million km2). Temporal scales may range from seasonal
to geological (up to hundreds of millions of years).
SRES scenarios
SRES scenarios are emissions scenarios developed by
Nakićenović and Swart (2000) and used, among others, as
a basis for some of the climate projections used in the IPCC
Fourth Assessment Report. The following terms are relevant
for a better understanding of the structure and use of the set of
SRES scenarios:
Scenario family: Scenarios that have a similar demographic,
societal, economic and technical-change storyline. Four
scenario families comprise the SRES scenario set: A1, A2,
B1 and B2.
Illustrative scenario: A scenario that is illustrative for
each of the six scenario groups reflected in the Summary
for Policymakers of Nakićenović and Swart (2000). They
include four revised ‘scenario markers’ for the scenario
groups A1B, A2, B1, B2, and two additional scenarios for
the A1FI and A1T groups. All scenario groups are equally
sound.
Marker scenario: A scenario that was originally posted
in draft form on the SRES website to represent a given
scenario family. The choice of markers was based on which
of the initial quantifications best reflected the storyline,
and the features of specific models. Markers are no more
likely than other scenarios, but are considered by the SRES
writing team as illustrative of a particular storyline. They
are included in revised form in Nakićenović and Swart
(2000). These scenarios received the closest scrutiny of
the entire writing team and via the SRES open process.
Scenarios were also selected to illustrate the other two
scenario groups.
Storyline: A narrative description of a scenario (or family of
scenarios), highlighting the main scenario characteristics,
relationships between key driving forces and the dynamics
of their evolution.
Stakeholder
A person or an organisation that has a legitimate interest in a
project or entity, or would be affected by a particular action or
policy.
Storm surge
The temporary increase, at a particular locality, in the height
of the sea due to extreme meteorological conditions (low
atmospheric pressure and/or strong winds). The storm surge is
defined as being the excess above the level expected from the
tidal variation alone at that time and place.
Storm tracks
Originally, a term referring to the tracks of individual cyclonic
weather systems, but now often generalised to refer to the
regions where the main tracks of extratropical disturbances
occur as sequences of low (cyclonic) and high (anticyclonic)
pressure systems.
Storyline
A narrative description of a scenario (or a family of scenarios)
that highlights the scenario’s main characteristics, relationships
between key driving forces, and the dynamics of the scenarios.
Stratosphere
The highly stratified region of the atmosphere above the
troposphere extending from about 10 km (ranging from 9 km
in high latitudes to 16 km in the tropics on average) to about 50
km altitude.

Appendix II: Glossary
Streamflow
Water flow within a river channel, for example expressed in
m3/s. A synonym for river discharge.
Subsidy
Direct payment from the government or a tax reduction to a
private party for implementing a practice the government wishes
to encourage. The reduction of greenhouse-gas emissions is
stimulated by lowering existing subsidies that have the effect
of raising emissions (such as subsidies to fossil fuel use) or by
providing subsidies for practices that reduce emissions or enhance
sinks (e.g., for insulation of buildings or for planting trees).
Succulent
Succulent plants, e.g., cactuses, possessing organs that store
water, thus facilitating survival during drought conditions.
Sustainable development
Development that meets the needs of the present without
compromising the ability of future generations to meet their
own needs.
T.
Taiga
The northernmost belt of boreal forest adjacent to the Arctic
tundra.
Technology
The practical application of knowledge to achieve particular
tasks that employs both technical artefacts (hardware,
equipment) and (social) information (“software”, know-how
for production and use of artefacts).
Teleconnection
A connection between climate variations over widely separated
parts of the world. In physical terms, teleconnections are often
a consequence of large-scale wave motions, whereby energy
is transferred from source regions along preferred paths in the
atmosphere.
Thermal expansion
In connection with sea-level rise, this refers to the increase in
volume (and decrease in density) that results from warming
water. A warming of the ocean leads to an expansion of the
ocean volume and hence an increase in sea level. See Sea-level
change.
Thermocline
The region in the world’s ocean, typically at a depth of 1 km,
where temperature decreases rapidly with depth and which
marks the boundary between the surface and the ocean.
Thermohaline circulation (THC)
Large-scale, density-driven circulation in the ocean, caused by
differences in temperature and salinity. In the North Atlantic,
the thermohaline circulation consists of warm surface water
flowing northward and cold deepwater flowing southward,
resulting in a net poleward transport of heat. The surface water
sinks in highly restricted regions located in high latitudes. Also
called Meridional Overturning Circulation (MOC).
Thermokarst
A ragged landscape full of shallow pits, hummocks and
depressions often filled with water (ponds), which results from
thawing of ground ice or permafrost. Thermokarst processes
are the processes driven by warming that lead to the formation
of thermokarst.
Threshold
The level of magnitude of a system process at which sudden or
rapid change occurs. A point or level at which new properties
emerge in an ecological, economic or other system, invalidating
predictions based on mathematical relationships that apply at
lower levels.
Transpiration
The evaporation of water vapour from the surfaces of leaves
through stomata. See Evapotranspiration.
Trend
In this Technical Paper, the word trend designates a change,
generally monotonic in time, in the value of a variable.
Trophic relationship
The ecological relationship which results when one species
feeds on another.
Troposphere
The lowest part of the atmosphere from the surface to about
10 km in altitude in mid-latitudes (ranging from 9 km in high
latitudes to 16 km in the tropics on average), where clouds and
weather phenomena occur. In the troposphere, temperatures
generally decrease with height.
Tundra
A treeless, level, or gently undulating plain characteristic of the
Arctic and sub-Arctic regions characterised by low temperatures
and short growing seasons.
U.
Uncertainty
An expression of the degree to which a value (e.g., the future
state of the climate system) is unknown. Uncertainty can
result from lack of information or from disagreement about
what is known or even knowable. It may have many types of
sources, from quantifiable errors in the data to ambiguously
defined concepts or terminology, or uncertain projections of
human behaviour. Uncertainty can therefore be represented
by quantitative measures, for example, a range of values
calculated by various models, or by qualitative statements, for
example, reflecting the judgement of a team of experts. See also
Likelihood; Confidence.
United Nations Framework Convention on Climate
Change (UNFCCC)
The Convention was adopted on 9 May 1992 in New York and
182
Appendix II: Glossary
signed at the 1992 Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro by more
than 150 countries and the European Community. Its ultimate
objective is the ‘stabilisation of greenhouse gas concentrations
in the atmosphere at a level that would prevent dangerous
anthropogenic interference with the climate system’. It contains
commitments for all Parties. Under the Convention, Parties
included in Annex I (all OECD member countries in the year
1990 and countries with economies in transition) aim to return
greenhouse gas emissions not controlled by the Montreal
Protocol to 1990 levels by the year 2000. The Convention
entered in force in March 1994. See Kyoto Protocol.
Urbanisation
The conversion of land from a natural state or managed natural
state (such as agriculture) to cities; a process driven by net ruralto-
urban migration through which an increasing percentage of
the population in any nation or region come to live in settlements
that are defined as urban centres.
V.
Vector
An organism, such as an insect, that transmits a pathogen from
one host to another.
Vector-borne diseases
Diseases that are transmitted between hosts by a vector organism
(such as a mosquito or tick); e.g., malaria, dengue fever and
leishmaniasis.
Vulnerability
Vulnerability is the degree to which a system is susceptible to,
and unable to cope with, adverse effects of climate change,
including climate variability and extremes. Vulnerability is a
function of the character, magnitude, and rate of climate change
and variation to which a system is exposed, its sensitivity, and
its adaptive capacity.
W.
Water consumption
Amount of extracted water irretrievably lost during its use (by
evaporation and goods production). Water consumption is equal
to water withdrawal minus return flow.
Water security
Reliable availability of water in sufficient quantity and quality
to sustain human health, livelihoods, production and the
environment.
Water stress
A country is water stressed if the available freshwater supply
relative to water withdrawals acts as an important constraint on
development. In global-scale assessments, basins with water
stress are often defined as having a per capita water availability
below 1,000 m3/yr (based on long-term average runoff).
Withdrawals exceeding 20% of renewable water supply have also
been used as an indicator of water stress. A crop is water stressed
if soil available water, and thus actual evapotranspiration, is less
than potential evapotranspiration demands.
Water-use efficiency
Carbon gain in photosynthesis per unit water lost in
evapotranspiration. It can be expressed on a short-term basis as
the ratio of photosynthetic carbon gain per unit transpirational
water loss, or on a seasonal basis as the ratio of net primary
production or agricultural yield to the amount of available
water.
Wetland
A transitional, regularly waterlogged area of poorly drained
soils, often between an aquatic and a terrestrial ecosystem,
fed from rain, surface water or groundwater. Wetlands are
characterised by a prevalence of vegetation adapted for life in
saturated soil conditions.

1. INTRODUCTION
In 2007, the Commission adopted a Communication on Water Scarcity & Drought (WS&D)1.
The Communication identified seven policy areas that had to be addressed if Europe was to
move towards a water-efficient economy. In October 20072 the Council supported the options
identified in the Communication and invited the Commission to review the strategy for
WS&D by 2012 and in 2008 the European Parliament adopted a resolution underlining that
urgent actions and more funds are needed. Action to improve the efficient use of water
resources should be seen in the context of the Flagship initiative on resource efficiency3 as
part of the Europe 2020 Strategy.
The first and second reports from 20084 and 20095 which followed the Communication on
water scarcity identified some encouraging policy initiatives at both EU and national levels
but concluded that there was still a lot to be done.
In June 2010, the Council recognised that WS&D are already serious problems in many
European regions and invited the Member States to promote more efficient and sustainable
water use and recalled that trustworthy data would be needed on WS&D events to support
further policy development. The Council invited the Commission to consider the right mix of
measures and financial instruments needed to tackle WS&D events and to present relevant
proposals as appropriate.
This report covers the period May 2009 to May 2010 and is based upon the responses of 21
countries to the Commission''s annual questionnaire.6 The situation concerning water scarcity
was as follows:
– Three Member States reported that they faced continuous water scarcity (CZ, CY, MT);
– Five Member States reported that they faced droughts or rainfall levels lower than the long
term average (FR, PT, HU, ES, UK); and
– Four Member States experienced local limited water scarcity occurrences (FR, NL, RO and
SE).

and Switzerland)
EN 3 EN
Consequently, mitigation actions were developed and restrictions were applied in order to
restrict water use (FR), irrigation (RO, SE, CY) and shipping (NL) in some of the affected
Member States. Six Member States reported that they did not experience drought or water
scarcity situations (AT, BE, EE, IE, LU, SK), and the same applied to Switzerland (CH). This
information reported by the Member States should be seen in relation to the 2010 State of the
Environment report from the European Environment Agency7 which states, that "Except in
some northern and sparsely-populated countries that possess abundant resources, water
scarcity occurs in many areas of Europe, particularly in the south, confronted with a crucial
combination of a severe lack of and high demand for water".
The present report gives further details on the extent of WS&D in the EU and the measures
which are being put in place to address both situations. The report also sets out the activities
to be implemented by the Commission in preparation for the 2012 review of WS&D policy.
2. TOWARDS A BLUEPRINT FOR SAFEGUARDING EUROPE''S WATERS
The Commission intends to adopt a "Blueprint" to safeguard Europe''s waters by the end of
2012 based on assessments of the implementation of the Water Framework Directive (WFD)8,
WS&D policy and the vulnerability of water resources to climate change and other man-made
pressures. This evaluation has a twofold purpose:
• It will look back and assess the implementation and achievements of policies and measures
in place to ensure the protection and availability of EU water resources, while identifying
gaps and shortcomings;
• It will look forward at the evolving vulnerability of the water environment to identify
measures and tools that will be needed in several EU policy areas in order to ensure a
sustainable use of water in the EU in the long term;
The Blueprint will synthesise policy recommendations and will be accompanied by a number
of new initiatives, including of a legislative nature if appropriate. The Blueprint will also
examine the needs for additional funding, incentives, measures and the establishment of the
necessary support for data collection, scientific and technological development. It will
consider the links between the various aspects of water policy, including those relating to
quality and availability. The Blueprint will be developed in close consultation with
stakeholders.
The work of the Commission will be supported by the core integrated analysis being
developed by the European Environmental Agency which links resource efficiency,
accounting, environmental externalities and policy instruments in the area of water.

3. REVIEW OF POLICY ON WATER SCARCITY AND DROUGHTS
The first consultation of stakeholders on the WS&D policy review took place in April 2010
when the Commission presented the main building blocks of the policy review and the
process and timing for preparing it.
The main building blocks of the WS&D policy review are:
• Water efficiency (in agriculture and the urban environment),
• Better planning (demand management, land use planning, drought observatory and
indicator development, enhancing integration of WS&D in the River Basin Management
Plans (RBMPs) and in sectoral policies) and
• Adequate implementation instruments (such as financing water efficiency, water pricing,
water allocation).
The policy review will also address the external dimension of the WS&D problem. In many
parts of the world, water resources are becoming more and more vulnerable and an important
part of EU''s water footprint (indicator for direct and indirect water use) is embedded in
imported water-expensive goods (such as agriculture, food and textile products). The water
foot printing and of life-cycle analysis approaches are increasingly used to raise awareness of
water consumption related to products or production processes, and the policy review will
assess to which extent these tools can be useful for policy purposes.
4. IMPROVING WATER EFFICIENCY
In accordance with the water hierarchy described in the 2007 Communication, improved
water efficiency will be an important part of the policy review on WS&D including the
following specific topics.
Water efficiency of buildings
Most Member States have so far not implemented national legislation in terms of water
efficiency standards in buildings or water using devices, though some aspects are included in
RBMPs (BG, CY, IE, SK). The UK has defined new water efficiency targets for water
companies.
At the end of 2010, the Commission launched a study to analyse further the possibilities for
improving the water performance of buildings across Europe. The Commission will look at
three aspects of improvement to the water performance of buildings, namely water saving
devices; water-efficient construction, design and renovations; and measuring building''s
performance.
The study will determine which regulatory or non-regulatory measures will be the most
appropriate to improve water efficiency in buildings, ranging from a directive (similar to the
EN 5 EN
directive on energy performance of buildings9), to integration of water efficiency into existing
regulatory measures and a mixture of other measures and standards. The environmental,
economic and social impacts of the proposed measures will be evaluated.
Reduction of leakages in distribution systems
One of the means of increasing water efficiency is to reduce leakages from water distribution
networks. Studies have so far indicated that as much as 50% of water abstracted is lost in
distribution in certain areas of Europe. However, there are significant differences between the
leakage levels in different Member States.
The Member States also report that they consider leakage reduction a relevant issue and
thirteen of them (AT, BE, BG, CY, ES, FR, IE, IT, MT, PT, RO, SE, SK, UK) report that
significant activities in this respect have taken place in the reporting period. Measures which
have been implemented include periodical maintenance works, updated guidelines, detection,
leakage quantification and reduction measures, new legislation binding local authorities to
promote action plans and multi-annual work programmes, integration of measures to restore
water networks in RBMPs and National Programmes. In some Member States, network
renewal is not planned (CZ, EE, HU, LU) whilst the Netherlands has stated that leakage in its
supply network for drinking water is low (<5%) and thus no measures to reduce leakages are
considered necessary.
In 2010, following a request of the European Parliament, the European Commission launched
a pilot project to investigate the resource and economic efficiency of water distribution
networks. The project will comprise 5-8 pilot studies to analyse and quantify factors of
relevance for leakages in distribution networks at a river basin level. It will also identify costeffective
solutions for reducing water losses and present recommendations on policy options
for improving water efficiency in distribution systems.
Water efficiency in agriculture
A Commission Communication on the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) towards 2020 was
adopted in November 201010. Besides the contribution of agriculture to a greater resilience to
flooding and drought, it also recognised that many farming practices have the potential to put
pressure on the environment, leading to soil depletion, water shortages, pollution, and loss of
biodiversity. The inclusion of the Water Framework Directive within the scope of cross
compliance will be considered, once the Directive has been implemented and the operational
obligations for farmers have been identified.
The Farm Advisory Services (FAS) were set up in Member States to assist farmers in
complying with the cross compliance standards. Water is not always addressed to the same
extent in the FAS of the different MS; additional guidance was needed, and the Commission
and stakeholders therefore developed a handbook for administrations about integrating water
issues in the FAS11.
9 Directive 2002/91/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 16 December 2002 on the
energy performance of buildings
10 COM(2010) 672 final, 18.11.2010
11 http://ec.europa.eu/environment/water/quantity/good_practices.htm#handbook
EN 6 EN
At the end of 2010 the Commission launched a study aimed at having an overview of the
current situation of agricultural water use in Europe. The study will compile information on
possibilities for water saving in agriculture.
Non-authorized water abstraction was addressed at a conference hosted by the Belgian
Presidency in 2010. Many Member States face non-authorised water abstractions which affect
water availability. Better control is required to identify and penalise this misuse, and the
Commission intends to continue to put focus on this issue in preparation for the policy review.
Halting desertification
In 2010, the Commission launched pilot projects on halting desertification upon a request by
the European Parliament with the aim of disseminating best practices across Europe. The
projects will also provide examples of water efficiency measures and will contribute with
examples and best practices to the WS&D policy review.
5. BETTER PLANNING
In parallel to looking at ways to improve water efficiency, the WS&D policy review will also
look at possibilities for better planning and preparedness to deal with droughts and improved
water demand management.
Activities to integrate water scarcity and droughts into sectoral policies have been undertaken
by several Member States, in particular efforts to reduce water consumption (AT, BG, BE,
CY, FR, HU, IT, MT, RO, SK, NL, LU, RO), and adaptation to climate change (AT, ES, PT
and CH). The integration of WS&D actions into RBMPs (BE, CY, HU, IT, MT, RO, SK, NL)
and specific national programmes (BG, LU, UK) concerning industry, agriculture (LU, RO)
and households was also reported.
Implementation of the River Basin Management Plans
Adoption of river basin management plans for each river basin district under the WFD had to
be completed by December 2009 whilst the relevant information had to be reported to the
Commission by 22 March 2010. As of December 2010, several of the Member States where
water scarcity and/or drought is expected to be most severe (CY, EL, ES, PT, RO) had still
not published their RBMPs.
In 2010, the implementation of the RBMPs started in the Member Sates. At the same time the
Commission launched the assessment of the submitted plans which will also address WS&D.
The report on how Member States have tackled their RBMPs will be published in 2012 as part
of the Blueprint.
Further developing the observatory and an early warning system on droughts
The prototype of the European Drought Observatory (EDO) has been further developed
providing for the continuous monitoring of drought indicators across Europe and displaying
these on a map server. All indicators cover the entire European continent and are presented as
actual data and as deviation from the expected long-term average. In the long run, GMES
services might be useful to support the operational monitoring activities.
EN 7 EN
In 2010, the first tests for meteorological drought forecasting were performed and the first
interoperability arrangements set up with regional, national and local services including the
Drought Management Centre for South East Europe, the Spanish Observatory for
Sustainability and the Ebro River Basin Authority.
Data collection and setting up of a comprehensive indicator framework
Important knowledge gaps still exist as regards WS&D in the EU and trustworthy and
comparable data are needed about the temporal and spatial distribution of water scarcity and
droughts events, the expected impacts of climate change on water resources and the
vulnerability of ecosystems, as well as the associated socio-economic aspects.
As a part of the Common Implementation Strategy for the WFD period 2010-2012, an Expert
Group is working on defining water scarcity and drought indicators. Different indicators are
needed for the evaluation of water scarcity and for droughts respectively. Indicators on water
scarcity often follow a pressure-state-response approach and compare water abstraction/water
use with long term availability. Common drought indicators are based on meteorological and
hydrological variables such as rainfall, stream flow, soil moisture, reservoir storage, and
ground water levels.
The Commission is also developing12 a set of vulnerability indicators for water related
impacts under a set of climate change and socio-economic scenarios, and performing an
inventory of potential adaptation measures and assessment of their impact, which gives a
strong emphasis to WS&D issues.
The Commission has started an assessment of natural water retention measures and their
potential impact i.e. on WS&D prevention. An upcoming Commission Communication will
address the multiple benefits of green infrastructure including its role in water retention and
mitigating the effects of extreme events. Green infrastructure assists the keeping of water in
river basins for a longer timescale, enabling soil, forest, grassland and wetland ecosystems to
deliver their water retention and disposal services.
Furthermore, the EEA is progressively implementing water accounts across Europe in
cooperation with Eurostat and the Joint Research Centre in order to support the adoption of a
more sustainable approach to water resource management. The accounts quantify water
availability and use by all sectors, at a river basin scale and on a monthly basis. The approach
enables ‘hotspots’ of water stress to be identified and over-exploitation to be quantified. In
this way measures to address unsustainable water use can be targeted in an optimal manner.
The first results are expected to be available in 2011.
6. INSTRUMENTS
Financing
European funds and state aids offer more and more opportunities to meet the challenge of
water scarcity and droughts. At European level the allocation of funding should be consistent
with the Europe 2020 targets including environmental concerns and resource efficiency.
12 www.climwatadapt.eu
EN 8 EN
The Commission adopted a Communication on the post-2013 review of the EU''s budget in
October 201013. In the field of Cohesion Policy, the Commission has suggested a new
planning and management cycle to ensure that future EU funding is firmly linked to the
Europe 2020 targets.
In Commission Communication on ''Regional Policy contributing to Sustainable Growth in
Europe 2020''14, managing authorities are encouraged to use Regional Policy funding for
natural risk prevention projects that can preserve ecosystem services such as water quality and
quantity, and prioritize ''''green infrastructures'''' such as flood plains restoration, which allow
for preserving clean water availability. In addition they are asked to fully consider the water
hierarchy and give priority to projects on water savings and water efficiency.
The recent Communication on the orientation of reform to the Common Agricultural Policy
(CAP) mentions that future direct payments should include a mandatory greening component.
by supporting environmental measures applicable across the whole EU territory. These should
take the form of simple, generalized, non contractual and annual actions and are linked to
agriculture (e.g. permanent pasture, green cover, crop rotation and ecological set-aside). They
could contribute to the improvement of water resources, as farmers will have to engage
actively in farming practices that bring benefits also for water quality and improve water
management.
Member States plan to spend 26,9% of CAP Health-Check and European Economic Recovery
Plan (EERP) funds on water management. Of these funds, for the remainder of the current
period, the various rural development programmes set out planned spending of 184 million
Euros for water storage, 568 million Euros on water savings technologies and 119 million
Euros for wetland restoration15. In the coming years rural development policy will remain an
indispensable tool for improving care for the EU''s precious water resources.
The EU Solidarity Fund still applies a delay of 10 weeks following the onset of damage
caused by a disaster. For slowly unfolding disasters this provision implies an objective
difficulty to present applications to the Commission within the application period. A
Communication on the future of the EU Solidarity Fund will be published in the first half of
2011, addressing also the issue of slowly unfolding disasters such as droughts.
The European Investment Bank (EIB) emphasizes resource efficiency and optimizing
solutions in their Water Sector Lending Policy. The current water efficiency concept includes
efficiency by the consumer, in allocation across different users, of service providers as well as
efficiency of the physical systems. In 2009/10, the lending in the EU water sector was 4,3/5,4
billion EUR with total project cost of 14/13 billion EUR, half of which was for water supply.
A 100 million EUR loan was approved to for a water distribution project in Madrid that will
include investments in treatment and distribution of recycled water.
Water pricing and funding at national level

14 COM(2011) 17 final of 26 January 2011
15 Commission fact sheet :Overview of the CAP Health Check and the European Economic Recovery Plan
EN 9 EN
At national level the use of national budgets (BG, FR, EE, ES, LU, MT, PT, SK), EU funds
(CY, CZ, HU, MT, SK) and private funds (IT, PT) were reported to be used to finance better
water management and to improve water efficiency.
In several Member States water-tariffs have been introduced recently (AT, BG, BE, EE, ES,
NL, SE, UK) or are under development (CY, CZ, IE, RO, SK) in order to ensure cost
recovery for water services. The metering of water consumption was reported being extended
in most Member States.
The Commission has also launched an assessment comprising the analysis of case studies on
water pricing policies for the agricultural sector in selected river basins. Recommendations on
best practices will be drawn this assessment.
Water allocation
Following the CAP Health Check, from 2010 the Member States will have to define standards
applying at farm level for compliance with existing national authorisation procedures when
using water for irrigation. In 2010, all but one Member State notified standards on
authorisation for the use of water for irrigation, linking the payments with permitting. The
Commission is carefully following the application of the cross-compliance rules and financial
corrections might be applied if these are not implemented correctly.
The national reports show that the use of an authorization procedure for water abstraction is
widespread in the EU, and some Member States (MT, IE) are improving their current
procedures in order to comply with the WFD. In the EU and in Switzerland restrictions in
water use are applied in order to preserve aquatic life and ecological status of water bodies
(AT, CY, CZ, ES, FR, HU, IT, NL, PT, RO, SK, SE, UK) although these have not yet been
fully implemented everywhere (BE, BG, EE, IE, LU, MT).
Most Member States (except UK and ES; and BE that introduced ecocheques) do not
envisage setting up water markets to address water scarcity.
The water hierarchy approach is taken into consideration in the planning procedures, but the
design and construction of new water supply networks or reservoirs (BG, CZ, EE, FR, IE,
PT, RO, SK, SE), and desalination plants (CY, UK) have been reported as necessary.
Research and technological development opportunities
In the framework of the XEROCHORE research project, guidance documents and
recommendations were issued on drought-related knowledge base. An exchange platform on
drought issues was set up and is now maintained and developed by the European Drought
Centre16. .New FP7 research projects have been launched, namely DEWFORA (Improved
drought early warning and forecasting to strengthen preparedness and adaptation to droughts
in Africa), and SIRRIMED (Sustainable use of irrigation water in the Mediterranean region).
Furthermore a call for proposals "Vulnerability and increased drought risks in Europe" was
opened in 2011.
16 http://www.geo.uio.no/edc/
EN 10 EN
FP6 projects covering WS&D (WATCH17, CIRCE project18) will deliver before the end of
2011.
At national level research linked to adaptation to climate change (BE, AT, CZ, ES, UK) and
sustainable water management (BE, BG, CH, CY, ES, HU, LU, MT, RO, NL) were reported.
Education and awareness
Many countries reported the introduction of new educational programmes and awarenessraising
campaigns, regardless of whether they were expecting (CH, ES, SE, SK) or not (AT,
EE, FR, IE, IT, MT, PT, UK, NL, RO) water scarcity situations in the 2010-2011 period.
As part of the preparations for the WS&D policy review the Commission will look at further
possibilities for awareness raising and educational activities.
7. CONCLUSIONS
The efficient use of water and effective management of natural water resources in a world
where water resources are under significant pressure is about ensuring that natural water
resources are sustained in terms of quality and quantity to meet the needs of humans, nature
and the economy through integrated management.
This report is focused on the building blocks of the future WS&D policy - water efficiency,
better planning and adequate implementation instruments – which are key elements of the
establishment of a water efficient economy that meets the challenge of the EU 2020 strategy.
The next milestone of the WS&D policy is its review which will be published in 2012, in the
Year of Water, as part of the Blueprint for Europe''s waters.
In the next months, the Commission will focus on filling knowledge and data gaps and
conducting an impact assessment for the review. The work will be supported by the outcomes
of the assessment of the RBMPs, the modelling of water vulnerability to man-made pressures,
the cost-benefit analysis of natural water retention measures, the inputs from EEA, JRC and
Eurostat and the forthcoming Communication on a road map towards a resource efficient
economy.

Experiences that can be exchanged									In order to generate new insights into the effects of climate change and coastal management practises on coastal erosion and flood risk, an integrated assessment of both phenomenon over 72 km of shoreline for the twenty-first century on the East Anglian coast of England has been done. This is a site of significant controversy about how to manage coastal flood and erosion risks over the twenty-first century. The principles shown here could be applied in other environments such as estuaries and deltas which have also been identified as very vulnerable to climate change									4. Overview of the case									Risk analysis under scenarios of future climate and socio-economic change has been applied to analyse alternative coastal management options on a 72 km stretch of UK coastline that has experienced flooding and cliff erosion for many centuries. Whilst the concept of integrated assessment of coastal risks is not new, this analysis is notable in its deployment of physically-based models over such a large spatial scale and extended timescale.									5. Context and Objectives									a) Context									The case study site is a 72 km length of coastline and hinterland between Weybourne and Lowestoft on the east coast of England. It is designated as a ‘coastal sub-cell’ (number 3b) in UK coastal management planning which means that it is reasonably self-contained in terms of sedimentary interactions with neighbouring coastlines. The north of the site is comprised of  retreating chalk and till cliffs, whereas the southern area of the site is generally low lying and at risk of coastal flooding. There are currently almost 20,000 properties at risk of coastal flooding in the area, over 3,000 of which are non-residential. Almost 50% of the floodplain, which is almost 340 km2, is premium agricultural land. Some 35%, is registered as being environmentally sensitive (with Sites of Special Scientific Interest, Ramsar, salt marsh, national nature reserve designations). Along the 32 km stretch of eroding coastline there are almost 1,400 properties within 100 m of the cliff top. Of this area, 37% is premium agricultural land and a further 50% is less productive agricultural land. The study area has a long history of erosion and flooding, but climate change exacerbates both these risks in terms of loss of buildings on the cliff coast and increased flood risk in the coastal lowlands. Erosion risk is exacerbated by trends for increased building in these areas, although planning regulations for cliff top areas do take specific account of risks associated with coastal erosion.									The risks to human populations in coastal areas are changing due to climate and socio-economic changes, and these trends are predicted to accelerate during the twenty-first century. To understand these changing risks, and the resulting choices and pathways to successful management and adaptation, broad-scale integrated assessment is essential. Due to their complexity, the two risks of flooding and erosion are usually managed independently, yet frequently they are interconnected by longshore exchange of sediments and the resulting broad scale morphological system behaviour.  Given the uncertainties in the future sea level rise, and the extent to which this influences the effectiveness of different management strategies, an adaptive strategy that is continuously reviewed in the light of new information is most appropriate.									b) Objectives									The aim of the work was to apply risk analysis under scenarios of future climate and socio-economic change to analyse alternative coastal management options on a 72 km stretch of UK coastline that has experienced flooding and cliff erosion for many centuries.									6. Implementation of the ICZM Approach (i.e. management, tools, resources)									a) Management									The work was conducted in the Tyndall Centres for Climate Change Research in the School of Civil Engineering and Geosciences, Newcastle University; the School of Civil Engineering and the Environment, Southampton University; the School of Mechanical, Aerospace and Civil Engineering, University of Manchester; and the School of Environmental Sciences, University of East Anglia as well as the School of Geography, Geology and Environmental Science, the University of Auckland and ABP Marine Environmental Research, Southampton. 									b) ICZM tools									The study looked at five cliff erosion management scenarios ranging from a highly artificial state in which the whole coast is permanently protected with a through to full abandonment for which all defence structures are removed. Intermediate management scenarios corresponded closely to suggested strategies that have been proposed in practice i.e. some form of coastal defence (seawall, groynes, or palisades) is maintained along about 71% (the current state), 34% and 16% (Scenario D) of the cliff coast. The assessment was conducted with a coupled system of hydrodynamic, morphological and impacts models used in a baseline assessment of the risk in 2003 and then modified to include scenarios of  climate change, demographic &amp; economic change and shoreline management options implemented separately and/or in combinations. Because the occurrence of damaging erosion or flooding on the coast is determined by highly variable marine processes (surge tides, extreme waves) and the (uncertain) responses of the coastal system, it was impossible to predict coastal flooding and erosion in deterministic terms. Therefore, a risk-based approach was adopted in which coastal behaviour was predicted, through time, in probabilistic terms and combined with an assessment of impacts in order to quantify the ‘expected annual damage’. The primary parameter used for the comparison of scenarios and management options was economic risk but this could be supplemented by indicators of potential social or environmental impact if available. 									A coupled system of hydrodynamic, morphological, reliability and socio-economic models was developed for the analysis, implemented under scenarios of coastal management, climate and socio-economic change. Such an integrated assessment allowed the effects of (1) a range of climate change factors, particularly (a) sea-level rise, (b) wave height, and (c) wave direction, (2) different coastal defence management choices, and (3) socio-economic development, on the evolution of flood and erosion risk to be examined. The analysis indicates that the main drivers for flood risk over the 21st Century in northern East Anglia are a consequence of a combination of rising sea levels, local and broad-scale natural and anthropogenically driven morphological change that may lower or raise beach levels and changes in exposure to flooding and erosion due to socio-economic changes.									The results from this study have quantified the connectivity between the various geo-morphological features that comprise the natural coastal system and shown, quantitatively for the first time, that the vulnerabilities of the different parts of a coastal sub-cell are not independent. Clearly it is inappropriate to consider erosion and flood hazards in isolation. Rather, analysis of climate impacts and long-term coastal management must be implemented at a broader scale that accounts for this morphological inter-dependence. Currently, this is generally not the case. Coastal erosion and flooding are typically assessed independently and the governance structures do not always match the scale at which management is required.									The results also demonstrate that over the twenty-first century, significant benefits in terms of mitigating flood risk can be obtained by allowing previously defended cliffs to erode naturally. These benefits are greatest under high sea level rise scenarios. The economic analysis also strengthens the argument for allowing some of the coastline to return to a more natural configuration and for negotiating compensation to landowners and householders to facilitate a change back to a more natural and dynamic shoreline. However, the social implications for cliff-top communities of such a policy are significant. The changes in risk are predicted to be quite steady over the first half of the twenty-first century, allowing time for planned adaptation. However, given the slow turnover of housing and infrastructure, plans for managed retreat from parts of the coast need to be implemented now if excessive adaptation costs are not to be incurred in the latter half of the twenty-first century. 									7. Cost and resources									This work was funded by the Tyndall Centre for Climate Change Research through their ongoing coastal programme.									8. Effectiveness (i.e. were the foreseen goals/objectives of the work reached?)									Within the UK there are now moves to develop a more holistic approach to flood and erosion management that is risk based and recently there have been a range of strategies, consultations and planning documents produced that impact on the management of the coast e.g. Shoreline Management Plans. Other important initiatives include Making Space for, planning guidance through Planning Policy Statement 25 and Local Development frameworks as well as a number of coastal and maritime strategies.									9. Success and Fail factors									Visualisation of the results from the simulation models provide a potentially powerful tool for motivating and engaging policy makers and stakeholders.									10. Unforeseen outcomes									The progressive transformation of policy in the UK is proving controversial due to commonplace expectation amongst the general public that a ‘hold the line’ policy will be maintained. Further work is needed to better understand the socio-economic issues associated with coastal risk management. 									11. Prepared by									A. H.

Experiences that can be exchanged									An example of ecosystem restoration for the purpose of coastal flood risk reduction and habitat creation by managed realignment. This is the re-positioning of an existing hard sea defence to a more landward location allowing accommodation space by the creation of inter-tidal habitat. The resultant increase in the intertidal zone has allowed increased flood water storage and wave attenuation. It was conducted in 2002. 									4. Overview of the case									Freiston Shore illustrates that managed realignment can be a viable and successful strategy to adapt to the impact of sea level rise and/or increased wave action on low-lying coasts. By providing additional flood storage capacity and inter-tidal surfaces that attenuate incident wave energy, flood risk is reduced, at least in the short to medium term, after the new intertidal surface has become stabilised and vegetated. 									5. Context and Objectives									a) Context									Freiston Shore is located on the east coast of England, on the Lincolnshire coast of the Wash embayment, covering 615 km2 below high water. The Wash itself is the most important area in the UK for wintering and migrating waterbirds; it attracts more than 300,000 birds a year and has multiple nature conservation designations (SSSI, SPA, cSAC, Ramsar). The area surrounding Freiston Shore experiences socio-economic issues distinct from many other parts of the UK, such as a dispersed population base and over-reliance on agriculture and land-based economics. Much of the Lincolnshire coast has been previously embanked and reclaimed, so land use within this region is predominantly agricultural, with 85% of the tidal flood plain area classed as rural. Shell fisheries (cockles, mussels and oysters) do contribute to the local economy. Tourism is also a vital component of the coastal area for activities such as walking and bird watching.									Managed realignment was originally proposed at Freiston Shore due to increased rates of erosion experienced at the base of the 1,750m long sea wall. It was a focus of erosion due to its construction too far seawards, compared to the surrounding artificial shoreline making it susceptible to wave attack.To repair and maintain this flood defence over a 50yr period was estimated at £2.47million. A managed realignment option was more cost effective at £1.98million. 									Some 1,100m of the remnant landward sea wall were enforced, and a new 500m cross wall built. The material for these works was sourced on site (the borrow pit was later developed into a 15ha saline lagoon).  Prior to breaching the sea wall, the vegetation on the 66ha site was cut, baled and removed, field drains were infilled (as far as fill material was available) and some 1,200m of artificial creek system were dug (two channels leading from each breach). Outside the site, some 50m of the external primary creek network were deepened. Finally, three 50m wide breaches were created in the outer sea wall (with channels initially 2m wide and 1m deep). In addition, to the full coastal realignment, a smaller (15 ha) saline lagoon was created, allowing regulated sluice-controlled exchange of tidal water on the highest spring tides of the year only.									The realignment created 66 ha of saltmarsh habitat and 15 ha of saline lagoon helping to protect more than 80,000 ha of low-lying land including many villages and the town of Boston (population ca. 35,000). An environmental monitoring programme of the site, and adjacent intertidal habitats, was set up. It investigated accretion/erosion rates; vegetation colonisation, establishment and succession; invertebrate colonisation; and fish utilisation.  									b) Objectives									The purpose of the managed realignment was originally focused on issues of coastal defence. However, its importance in helping to meet national and international targets for the maintenance and creation of key coastal habitats was also recognised.									6. Implementation of the ICZM Approach (i.e. management, tools, resources)									a) Management									The Department of the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (DEFRA) has the ultimate responsibility for coastal defence and management policy. The Environment Agency (EA) was responsible for the planning, execution, and maintenance of the scheme. English Nature (now Natural England) was involved in the planning process due to the potential for damage to protected areas. The site was purchased by the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds and is now managed as one of its reserves.									b) ICZM tools									Monitoring reports concluded that in the five years after breaching the sea wall, the realignment site had accreted sediment at similar rates to those of the adjacent salt marsh at the equivalent elevation range.The pattern of natural inter-annual variations inside the realignment also matched those outside. Vegetation establishment was more rapid than in other managed realignment sites and species abundance and community types would be equivalent to those outside the site within a further 5 years. The nature of the fauna (seasonal and weather-dependent activity of mobile organisms and large variation in numbers of small species) made it difficult to make comparisons between years, or between the realignment site and the adjacent marsh, from an annual survey. However, most species found outside were recorded in the site and many species have increased in abundance.The brief annual fish surveys showed that the realignment site acts as a fish nursery habitat for several commercially important species (such as bass, sprat, and herring) which were shown to be feeding in the realignment site. The site continues to provide nursery habitat throughout the entire tidal cycle (i.e. during neap tides when the site is disconnected from the sea). Whilst overall, the site appears to be draining well, some 5.6ha are not draining after the tide has receded, with subsequent implications for sediment stability and vegetation development.   In contrast to some other realignment sites, creeks in the site are developing through the agricultural soil.									The re-alignment area now supports large numbers of wintering waterbirds, several species in nationally important (i.e. &gt; 1% of the UK population) numbers. Whilst some bird numbers increased (such as skylarks and meadow pipits), others declined.  Avocets bred for the first time in South Lincolnshire on the newly created lagoon islands. Furthermore, Freiston Shore now attracts 57,000 visitors a year, compared to 11,000 before realignment) and it is estimated that the reserve supports some four full-time equivalent jobs in local businesses.									7. Cost and resources									The capital costs of £1.98 million were raised from the Environmental Agency’s flood defence budget, with contributions from DEFRA and the Lincolnshire Flood Defence Committee. The RSPB spent £150,000 to purchase the realignment site, and 15ha adjacent to it.  Site maintenance is funded through the income from the DEFRA Countryside Stewardship scheme (£34,500 per annum for 20 years).  £400,000 was allocated for monitoring (DEFRA contributed some 45%).									8. Effectiveness (i.e. were the foreseen goals/objectives of the work reached?)									Saltmarsh formed faster than expected: just 13 months after the breach, 61-71% of the realignment area had been colonised by 11 different species of saltmarsh plants; and eight species of fish were also recorded. As a result, birds such as dark-bellied brent geese, golden plover, lapwing, dunlin and oystercatcher have all increased in numbers. Avocets have also started to breed on the newly created lagoon islands for the first time.Visitor attraction has been estimated to bring £150,000 into the local economy as well as supporting four full time jobs in the local area. The managed realignment is providing a longer-term solution to disaster risk reduction. Re-aligning to the secondary defence line was predicted to maintain the saltmarsh strip for more than 200 years compared to 12-25 years with the previous defence line.									9. Success and Fail factors									A flexible approach and consultation with a range of non-governmental organisations and stakeholders were key to the success of the scheme. A  particular issue experienced at Freiston Shore was distrust of the authorities and organisations involved in the consultation, planning and funding processes.The successful vegetation establishment was attributed mainly to the suitable site elevations and the abundant supply of seeds and tiller fragments from the extensive external salt marsh. The realignment site has had no adverse effects on the adjacent saltmarsh. The continued monitoring of site conditions before, during, and after implementation is critical.Many of the obstacles to the success of the managed realignment were not due to the nature of coastal hazards but were rather linked to social and economic issues e.g. the negative perception of stakeholders (landowners, local groups) and the public towards realignment. In particular, stakeholders have a perception of a defeatist attitude that is ‘giving in to the sea’. There is also an element of ‘feeling safer’ behind a large, engineered defence structure. Sea walls, for example may be perceived as a more effective coastal defence compared to a more natural managed realignment.									10. Unforeseen outcomes									The realignment site has provided an important nursery area for 12 species of fish, including economically important species e.g. European sea bass (Dicentrarchus labrax) and Atlantic herring (Clupea harengus). The changes in intertidal morphology made the area around an oyster farm, located to the south of the site, very unstable and ultimately led to the closure of the farm.There is a lack of knowledge about the impacts of realigned coastlines on the surrounding intertidal systems. 									11.

 ADAGIO investigated not only future scenarios and results based on modelling tools, but
also already visible (or known) ongoing changes of adaptation measures for a better and
realistic assessment of potential future adaptation measures at the regional level. For that a
bottom-up approach was applied rather than the top-down approach, which included to
gather feedbacks from local experts and farmers by e.g. using questionnaires. Finally,
ADAGIO should establish a continuously interacting information and discussion network,
connecting the research level with decision makers and support a holistic approach to solve
the related problems.

It is national legislation-based with certain prescribed institutional and human resource capacities and aims to balance both the nature and culture protection of a particular coastal territory with socio-economic development as well as using participatory integration and governance mechanisms.									4. Overview of the case									The North Vidzeme biosphere reserve (NVBR) was realised with the involvement of the main stakeholders and established by National law in 1997. The NVBR administration staff, who can be regarded as intermediary actors, are everyday professionals and dedicatedly engaged in sustainable coastal development (SCD) work. NVBR participatory SCD governance experience differs very positively from other coastal nature management practice examples with respect to legally designation and staffing of the nature protection territories.									5. Context and Objectives									a) Context									In the NVBR coastal region, there are 46 local municipalities, located in three administrative districts (before 2009), with a territory covering 457,600 ha. in NE Latvia at the Estonia border and including around 50 km coastline of the three coastal municipalities (population less as 10, 000 inhabitants) at the Gulf of Riga. Since 1997, the NVBR has worked with the University of Latvia in partnership with Salacgriva and Ainazhi coastal municipalities located within NVBR and also with Kolka and Lapmezhciems coastal municipalities located outside NVBR. This partnership work was conducted during 2007-2008 to analyze and compare nature protection governance systems in the several, traditional coastal national parks and the only Biosphere reserve in Latvia, particularly evaluating environmental collaboration aspects and perspectives in order to prepare proposals for participatory coastal management development. Although considerably successful in their main duty, they still lack public participation and a wider collaboration among other, different stakeholders. Apart from traditional nature protection, a number of investigation and/or infrastructure development projects, plans and feasibility studies have been conducted in the NVBR area involving local/regional stakeholders and using integrated and systemic approaches.									b) Objectives									To plan and implement actions within a Biosphere Reserve reconciling the demands for a ‘bottom-up” process with that of a “top-down” approach which requires collaborative communication (coastal sustainability and environmental communication) with complementary education and training and public participation. 									6. Implementation of the ICZM Approach (i.e. management, tools, resources)									a) Management									Overall public management in the Biosphere Reserve territory is the responsibility of the municipality. Nature environment protection and management and its interaction with public management sectors is the competence of the NVBR according to the special governmental law. Everyday performance is realised by the NVBR administration. This is supported by a Consultation council having representation of the main stakeholders in the region. 									b) ICZM tools									The main instruments used are legal and economic instruments, infrastructure and technical instruments, planning and institutional instruments, communication and integration instruments. Some activities of NVBR using these instruments are:																																to integrate different sectors as well as the interests of all target groups and general public;													communication, starting from individual information and problem solving discussions, NGO Forums, public hearings and planning seminars etc activities up to NVBR Consultation council level;													various formal and non-formal initiatives and innovations which are very characteristic for NVBR but could be regarded top-down (e.g. design of NVBR Environmental communication action programme in 2005 and an Environmental education strategy in 2007 etc).													communication through information materials and education and training sessions, courses, seminars etc. This includes participation in the proposal and planning preparations and design, implementation of coastal friendly activities in the field etc;													project design and management are important to give not only a solid financial background for SCD and real planning and practice development, but also collaboration and partnerships including. bottom-up proposals either from individuals or initiative groups and NGO‘s etc.																															7. Cost and resources									No information is available.									8. Effectiveness (i.e. were the foreseen goals/objectives of the work reached?)									Participatory coastal governance approaches and practice elements especially in the combination with collaborative communication are effective in the eventual development of ICZM.									9. Success and Fail factors									Long term planning and step wise implementation of ICZM could be done as project-based effort by local/regional municipalities and other main actors in the field. However, governmental ICZM support programmes and/or legal/planning arrangements are needed. 									10. Unforeseen outcomes									Various spin-off developments and also formation of particular initiative groups and project design and implementation. 									11.

Forests are complex ecosystems and subsequently forest research needs to apply different approaches to gain a better understanding of how they function. The European forest research community has carried out numerous important studies on forest biodiversity. However, many institutes maintain overlapping research infrastructures and often carry out similare studies without coordination. EVOLTREE WILL LAST FOUR YEARS and will create a Network of Excellence to integrate European research infrastructures and resources to study the adaptive capacity of tree species using sophisticated methods, and to engage the scientific community into a dialogue with policy-makers and other stakeholders.

Experiences that can be exchanged									The ability to combat long term sea level rise using the technique of sand nourishment, a method which involves the deposition of a layer of sand on the seabed or beach .									4. Overview of the case									An example of a means to combat coastal erosion as a mitigation measure against sea level rise using soft technical approaches (sand suppletion) whilst maintaining safety, a high-quality living environment and improved nature and recreational values.									5. Context and Objectives									a) Context									The coast of the Netherlands is situated between the northern Wadden coast and the southern estuary of the Meuse, at the North Sea. It consists of 350 kilometres of almost continuous shoreline, without the presence of tidal inlets, sea arms and islands. The coastline consists of sandy, multi-barred beaches and can be characterised as a wave dominated coast. The dunes, together with the beach and the shore face, offer a natural, sandy defence to the sea. Some areas are protected by hard structures such as dykes and dams.									The coast as a whole shows erosive behaviour. In most northern coastal sections, erosion occurs into deep water and the nearshore zone. In most southern sections, sedimentation occurs in the nearshore zone with erosion into deep water. Over the last 30 years, sand loss of approximately 1 million m3/yr has occurred from the coast of the Netherlands into deep water. Erosion is also occurring due to sea level rise and, in some spots, because of harbour dams; breakwaters constructed 30 years ago are still blocking sand flow. Although hard technical fixes had been largely used in the past to combat erosion, sand nourishment has been used since the early 1990’s. 									b) Objectives									The main objective is to control erosion in different parts of the coastline based upon different sea level rise scenarios. The timescale takes into account three sea level rise scenarios covering 5, 50-100, 100-200 years respectively. There are three options:																																Keeping pace with sea level changes which entails maintaining the current location of the erosion lines.													The inland scenario which allows for the inland shift of the erosion lines. Narrow dunes are widened by creating sand buffers.													The offshore solution which focuses on reducing the level of erosion during storms by moving the erosion lines offshore.																															The Dutch have further identified ten locations along the coast which will have to be reinforced by 2020 in order to continue to meet needed safety standards. These ‘weak links’ were revealed in 2003 when tests showed that waves strike the coast with a greater force than had previously been assumed. These approaches for improvement of safety have been integrated with enhancing spatial values (nature, recreation etc.) and involving all stakeholders in the plan development. 									6. Implementation of the ICZM Approach (i.e. management, tools, resources)									a) Management									The Ministry of Transport, Public Works and Water Management is the main body responsible at National level with complete responsibility for the work.									b) ICZM tools									The sea level rise scenarios are governed  by the national Third Coastal Policy and based upon the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change reports. Parliament adopted “Hold the line”, a policy which established the ‘basal coastline’ as the position of the coastline on 1st January 1990, and determined that the coastline should be prevented from moving inland. This is referred to as ‘dynamic preservation’ because where possible (from a safety point of view) maximum freedom is offered for natural processes. The sand nourishment method has been chosen because it is relatively cheap and because it fits with the natural characters of the Dutch coast. It also allows more flexibility towards combating coastal recession. Each year, approximately 12 million m3 of sand is applied to the beaches or seabed just off the coast.									7. Cost and resources									No information is available.									8. Effectiveness (i.e. were the foreseen goals/objectives of the work reached?)									The goal in the short term has been achieved. Good ICZM practice was taken into account (e.g. long term vision, different policy levels (horizontal) and different sectors (vertical policy integration) and stakeholders cooperated). The technique has received good support from the local populations largely because of the effect on recreational activities associated with beach extension and the protection of freshwater induced by the consolidation of dunes.									9. Success and Fail factors									Structural erosion is under control and this soft approach is offering opportunities for new developments. There are also prospects for allowing natural fluctuations whilst unwanted impacts can be stopped or reversed. Only in a few locations which have very steep underwater slopes is there concern about the sustainability of the method.									The effects of using artificial constructions to retain sand are unpredictable and those already built will affect the coast for years. Breakwaters constructed at IJmuiden in 1870, and extended at the beginning of the 1960s, are blocking sand flow as a result of which sand is able to accumulate on two sides. This has enabled the development of the Kennemerstrand beach on the southern side. However, further to the north (Heemskerk, Wijk aan Zee) and to the south (Bloemendaal, Zandvoort), the effects of the breakwaters are still visible as increased coastal erosion. The construction of breakwaters at Hook of Holland has had a similar result. 									10. Unforeseen outcomes									Deposition of a layer of sand on the seabed or beach can cause burial of its habitats but also provide new surface areas to be colonised. After sand extraction and nourishment, a decrease in species abundance and biomass occurs, followed by development of opportunistic species. Colonisation of a disturbed area may take place by immigration from its surroundings and by settlement of larvae from the water column. As a result of beach nourishment the safety of the dunes increases but can affect the local morphology of banks and gullies. This might have consequences for navigation, especially close to the harbour. Although the policy has proven to be successful to keep the coastline at its 1990 position, there is increased concern with regard to the fate of the strategic sediment reserves in deeper water, in view of sea level rise, new claims for sand mining and construction of new harbours									11.

An increase in research potential is envisaged through strategic partnerships based on existing international contacts, whereby young scientists could gain valuable know-how and experience abroad, while experienced colleagues would be invited to work at ARI HAS. Situated as it is in the centre of the Carpathian Basin, the Institute is ideally suited to become a RESEARCH, TRAINING and SERVICE CENTRE entrusted with countering the unfavourable effects of climate change in the region. 

 One of the fundamental aims of the project is to make specialists and future specialists in agriculture and crop production aware of the possible effects of climate change on farming, after which they must be taught how to reduce or eliminate the unfavourable effects of these changes. The demonstration of the cause and effect relationships involved in climate change will help to change attitudes to environment protection. It is therefore essential to spread this knowledge to as wide a public as possible.

The project partners from Italy, Greece, Germany, the Czech Republic, Slovenia and Romania are representative of the different environments and regional climates of CADSES. So far, many districts lack a monitoring system for risk prevention regarding climate change. Local residents and institutions often ignore the impact of climate change. The aim of the project is to make private and public actors in the agriculture sector sensitive to the possible consequences of climate change on production figures of agriculture. Beneficiaries and target groups of the project are actors from local and regional politics (environment and agriculture), the scientific sector and people involved in agriculture, such as farmers. The ACCRETe project targets the following results: 
- Establishment of a transnational network to examine how agriculture interferes with climate change in the partner regions, publication of the collected data,
- Informing, promoting and disseminating through three thematic work groups to change attitudes and raise awareness of the link between climate change and agriculture, also involving local actors, 
- Code of Attitude for farmers (on DVD). This presentation summarises risks for agriculture which are due to climate change. It will also promote attitudes which should help reduce human-induced impact on the climate, 
- A Transregional Declaration of Intent: “Transregional Understanding ACCRETe”. All partners will sign the declaration and show that they are firmly willing to follow up with research, co-operation, support of sustainable agriculture and activities related to the issues,

Experiences that can be exchanged									The way of producing an inventory and analysing most probable breaking points and calculating the most probable damage scenarios can be transferred to other Wadden sea islands. Many islands share common features: a ring of natural and technical storm flood defence measures, no permanent connection to the mainland, and if present a delicate natural freshwater source nourished by precipitation (though not all islands in the Wadden sea have such a natural freshwater source). However, risk management recommendations have to be based on each specific island conditions. 									4. Overview of the case									At first an inventory of physical and socio-economic conditions as well as existing coastal defence measures in the Langeoog flood unit was compiled. From these data, the consequences of probable breaking points in the flood defence belt were calculated, and the related damage estimated. Recommendations for risk reduction and risk management were based on the risk assessment study.  									5. Context and Objectives									a) Context									The case study area Langeoog is a Wadden sea island in the North Sea with an area of about 20 km2. It is a barrier island off the coast of the federal state Lower Saxony (Niedersachsen). The northern sea side coast is protected by dunes, while the Wadden sea side in the south is characterised by lowlands. About 2000 residents live in the village in the north-west of the island which covers an area of approximately 1.5 km2. Tourism is the main economic factor on the island with 179,000 guests and 1.5 million overnight stays. Part of the island belongs to the Wadden Sea National Park, access is restricted for conservation reasons. The island can be reached by ferries and with small aeroplanes. A road and a railway connect the harbour in the south with the village. Drinking water is extracted from the freshwater lens east of the village that is nourished by natural precipitation to the dunes and does not mix with the underlying heavier salt water. Flood protection is provided by the dunes and dykes around the lowlands. Dune erosion endangers the dunes'' function as a natural flood protection barrier and the freshwater reservoir below them by the possible inflow of salt water. Therefore, the dunes are protected: any other usage besides coastal defence is prohibited by law, beach nourishment and dune strengthening are further measures. The Lower Saxony Dyke Act defines coastal defence elements, general design rules, legal obligations and regulations. 									b) Objectives									The objectives were: assessment of the inventory of physical and socio-economic conditions as well as existing coastal defence measures in the Langeoog flood unit; estimation of the values, that are endangered by a flood (two probable scenarios); a state of the art risk assessment based on the modelled scenarios; development of recommendations for measures to reduce the risk of these specific cases and increase the safety standards according to them. The study ran from July 2002 to June 2005. 									6. Implementation of the ICZM Approach (i.e. management, tools, resources)									a) Management									Lower Saxony Water Management and Coastal Defence Agency (NLWKN) was responsible for this study. It is the responsible entity for coastal protection in federal state Lower Saxony. External scientific experts supported the work: the University ofKiel / Department of Geography, Water Board of Oldenburg and East Frisia (Oldenburgisch-Ostfriesischer Wasserverband OOWV), and the Technical University Braunschweig / Institute for Environmental Geology (IUG). 									b) ICZM tools									The weak points of the flood defences of the island were identified and probable impacts modelled to imply the scenarios in a risk analysis. The value of possible damage was calculated based on a hazard, vulnerability, and damage analysis. The scenarios were a dune breach or a dyke breach, respectively. The Hazard analysis was a one-dimensional numerical model which simulated beach and dune erosion, and the ProDeich model was used for a deterministic calculation of dyke failure. Risk elements in the study were buildings, vehicles, life stock etc. Estimated surge water levels were used to evaluate most probable flooding areas and the resulting water depths due to the specific scenarios. The small scale vulnerability analyses estimated the most probable damages to individual risk elements that a failure in the storm defences depending on the scenarios cause. Water propagation and depths are based on hydraulic calculations of water inflow at detected failure locations. The analysis was based on the MERK-project results that estimate values and damages. Thus, the probable damage for each risk element can be expressed as a monetary value. The effects on the freshwater supply by saltwater intrusion into the catchment area of the wells was calculated based on a numerical simulation; the vulnerability was estimated by experts and based on numerical models about salt concentration effects on the wells. The final risk analysis combines probability of the hazard analysis with the vulnerability of assets. 									A workshop was held to discuss matters with external experts. Additionally, the preliminary and final results were discussed with the local administration and council on the island. Despite the lack of some fine scale data the study provides a decision-making tool for planning future reinforcements of the coastal defences, and to improve action plans in case of flooding based on the estimation of most probable damages that occur. This is a new approach to risk management, at least for Lower Saxony. It provides a list of priority measures that have to be tackled to ensure a rational risk management, and improves safety standards. The study can be used as a decision-making tool providing data and methods to refine future defence planning, detecting weak spots in the defence systems to be reinforced, and it gives input to adjust contingency plans for flood catastrophes. 									7. Cost and resources									NLWKN secured national financing of €220,000 and a further  €110,000 was provided by the ERDF to conduct the research. 									8. Effectiveness (i.e. were the foreseen goals/objectives of the work reached?)									The risk assessment for Langeoog was the combination of an analysis of probable defence break points depending on hydrographic and morphological data with damage analysis in the likely flooded areas. The results were communicated to local experts and new recommendations for future flood risk management were provided. A part of the recommendation concerning freshwater safety was realised shortly after the work ended. Additionally, the detailed height information improved knowledge about best evacuation routes and the most endangered areas. However, some uncertainties prevail due to lack of a better data basis, and gaps in damage analysis. Still the modelled most probable risks were communicated to local experts, and recommendations for an improvement of risk management were developed. 									9. Success and Fail factors									Some hydrographical data were relatively coarse (time series on water levels) or not available (wave climate). Some geo-technical parameters and the failure mode for dune erosion had to be estimated. Scenario definitions were necessary to determine resulting flooding, thus the number of breaches at the same time, their location, and dimension are the most important parameters. The flood simulation was based on calculations using a reservoir cascade model and a GIS description of the flooded area, leading to a rough scale of water depths and its impact on threatened objects. The damage evaluation has also some uncertainties, for example the evacuation rate, or the limited number of value categories, and the exclusion of many intangible risk categories. Short term morphological changes may lead to significant different results of the failure calculation. Further research is necessary to improve the reliability of data on which the models are based. 									10. Unforeseen outcomes									The study results were presented to the local community to raise awareness. That led to the first consequences: around the end of the work the drinking water supplier had already realised the recommendations to protect the island''s freshwater reservoir from saltwater inflow. 									11.

The development of an ICZM pilot project at the local level helps to better understand what an adequate coastal management is and how far we are from a global ICZM implementation in the entire coastal zone.									4. Overview of the case									The Catalonian ICZM Strategic Plan is the response of the Catalonian Region to the European Commission Recommendation 413/2002/CE on the implementation of ICZM in Europe. It is based on the principles of sustainable development and integrated management, and is organized in 7 general objectives to be fulfilled through 4 working systems: the Information System, the Participation System, the Proposal System, and the Assessment and Monitoring System.									5. Context and Objectives									a) Context									The Catalonian coast, a 500 km rectilinear coast, is composed of different geographical features: the Pyrenees reaching the sea in the north, coastal cliffs, natural hidden pocket and long straight beaches, artificial beaches, deltas (Ebro Delta), islands, peninsulas, etc. Several urban areas are located on the coast, along with commercial and fishing ports. The Spanish Mediterranean coast has suffered an important transformation in the last decades caused by increasing urban and tourism developments: (i) high population density, especially during the summer; (ii) a percentage of urban and potentially urban areas much higher than in the rest of Spain; (iii) increasing tourism activities and infrastructurs construction; (iv) a massive building of the shoreline; (v) traffic problems. These facts cause an enormous pressure on the natural resources and the ecological and environmental quality: (i) progressive loss of landscapes values, (ii) coastal erosion problems; (iii) water cycle alteration; (iv) loss of marine biodiversity; (v) ecosystems at risk due to maritime, ports and industrial activities. Functionality, uses and values of coastal stretches have not been analysed before planning and implementing the coastal developments. The lack of territorial planning and proactive public policies (only reactive policies exist) has not helped to solve the problem. Besides that, competences on the coastal zone are shared between different sectoral administrations at the national, regional and local level. The geographical scale of implementation is Regional: the Catalonian region									b) Objectives									The aim of the Strategic Plan is to promote a change in the Catalonian coastal development to move towards sustainable development. A coastal diagnosis, a participatory process and the selection of key issues to identify 7 general objectives: (1) achieving a good state of coastal waters; (2) declaring relevant coastal areas as “non-urban land”; (3) improving the coastal urban system’s sustainability; (4) minimising the pollution risk of marine waters; (5) minimising the environmental and socio-economic risks and costs caused by coastal erosion; (6) preserving and recovering the marine and terrestrial biodiversity; (7) increasing and consolidating co-ordination and shared-responsibility between stakeholders and sectors. The timescale associated with the implementation is 15 years (2005-2020)									6. Implementation of the ICZM Approach (i.e. management, tools, resources)									a) Management									The Environmental, Territorial Policy and Public Works Departments from the Generalitat de Cataluña (Regional Government) applied in 2002, together with 6 Italian and 3 Spanish regions, for Interreg IIIB-MedOc funds for the development of the ENPLAN project on the Environmental Assessment of Plans and Projects. The key element of this project was the development of a demonstration plan in each region. The Catalonian Government selected the Catalonian ICZM Strategic Plan to be developed and environmentally assessed. This Plan was meant to be implemented through the existing planning instruments (Partial Plans, Sectoral Territorial Plans, Municipal Urban Plans, etc.), through the coordination of the different competent administrations. An important Participation Process has been carried out during the development of the Plan, involving administrations, experts, companies and society. 									b) ICZM tools									To develop the Strategic Plan, 4 working systems were created: 																																Information System, to integrate the knowledge dispersed among different stakeholders and sectors. An Environmental Information System was created, through the combination of a Set of Indicators and a Geographic Information System, to support the other systems by providing quantifiable indicators for (i) objectives definition and proposals systematisation, (ii) training and awareness, (iii) plan monitoring.													Participation System, to ensure the Plan’s legitimacy and include the territorial vision. This system was based on (i) an online tool associated with the Regional Government website, and (ii) four participatory conferences (information + participation) aimed towards administrations, experts, companies and society. Some results were the stakeholders inventory map (GIS database) and 4 thematic working groups where experts met several times to discuss the strategy’s lines of action regarding coastal erosion, water management, biodiversity and strategic sectors.													Proposal System, to facilitate the decision-making regarding the strategic actions to be proposed. From the defined objectives, an analysis of alternatives and scenarios to be achieved in the 15 years of the Plan’s viability was carried out.													Assessment and Monitoring System, to ensure the Plan sustainability and effectiveness during all its phases while supporting the development of the other three systems.																															These 4 systems allowed working in an integrated way to achieve the objectives. Besides, 5 Priority Lines of Actions (PLA) were developed: improving communication and participation through a Coastal Observatory and Coastal Forum; promoting the implementation of the Plan through a demonstration project in the Tordera delta; ensuring funding, development and implementation of the Plan, including the creation of a fund for coastal biodiversity and landscape protection and management; promoting the development of a Law for integral coastal protection; and promoting co-ordination in planning and management processes .									7. Cost and resources									The information about budget and manpower used for the implementation is not available.									8. Effectiveness (i.e. were the foreseen goals/objectives of the work reached?)									The line of actions related to the communications and participation improvement is one of the best developed: a Coastal Observatory was created within the El Far Consortium (Coastal Observatory of Catalonia) and is in charge of the development and maintenance of the Environmental Information System. The Mar de Begur Foundation developed a map-inventory of stakeholders. Regarding the Participation System, 500 persons attended the 4 participatory conferences, including administrations, private sectors, university and research centres, NGOs and mass media.  Although 10 years are still left to finish the planning horizon some PLAs are not moving forward, especially those related to institutional coordination and funding.									The fulfilled objectives have been achieved in the timescale defined. However, some objectives, such as increasing and consolidating coordination and shared-responsibility, are not moving forward. 									9. Success and Fail factors									Factors that were helpful in achieving the objectives were the following: (1) the regional government was already aware and trained in ICZM, as the Generalitat de Cataluña participated (as observer) in the Working Group on Indicators and Data (EU ICZM Expert Group); (2) the Catalonian ICZM Strategic Plan was framed in the ENPLAN project resulting in the unique Environmentally Assessed ICZM Plan in Europe at that time; (3) the implementation of a pilot project at the local level (Consorcio Colls i Miralpeix-Costas del Garraf).									Factors that were unhelpful were that: (1) the Plan was the response of an institutional requirement based at the same time on a European Recommendation, not being a process that emerged internally which is why the Plan does not properly address the governance and structural changes (competences, coordination, etc.); (2) no specific objectives or Lines of Actions were created for the general objective related to the administrative coordination, they were established to improve the strategic sectors environmental competitiveness, (3) the lack of sectoral political willingness; (4) difficulties to integrate and coordinate the coastal management process when competences are shared between several administrations  									10. Unforeseen outcomes									No unforeseen outcomes have been identified.									11.

Overview of the case									The coastline of West Jutland is extremely vulnerable to erosion from the North Sea. In the past, in order to help the socio-economic development of the area, hard structures were used as coastal flood defence mechanisms. A change of policy and transfer to predominantly soft techniques has led to a situation where erosion is no longer a problem. It has aided the tourist industry by re-creating beaches and safeguarded the socio-economic development of the local communities. 									5. Context and Objectives									a) Context									The Western coast of Jutland faces the North Sea and is typically sandy beaches in front of dune ridges. The coastal dunes form a belt up to 10 km wide and are particularly vulnerable to erosion. However, in the 70 km stretch enclosing the fjords of Ringkøbing and Nissum to Nissum Bay many of the dunes are very narrow, being hundred metres or less. Ringkøbing Fjord is Denmark’s largest enclosed fjord with an outlet to the North Sea at the lock in Hvide Sande. The fjord is 40 km long and 10 km wide. North of Ringkøbing fjord, the Nissum fjord is located with a surface of 70 km2. It is a shallow fjord area with shoals and sandbanks and with intertidal zones and salt marshes with brackish lagoons, meadows and reedbeds. The fjord is connected with the North Sea by sluices at the small town of Torsminde. Nissum Bay is the largest of the three bays and is connected to the North Sea by the Thyboron Channel. Average erosion of the west coast is 2 to 4 m. per year, with a maximum of 8 m a year. In the early 19th century, the dunes were stabilized by marram grass planting, and groynes were built which has resulted in reduced erosion. In 1981, in a severe storm, many dunes disappeared or were weakened along a 50 km length of the coast. The coastal area is important for agriculture viz. intensive cash crop and roughage production; tourism and recreation; fishing and aquaculture. Ringkøbing Fjord is a RAMSAR site.									The natural erosion from the North Sea has been greatly exacerbated by human intervention e.g. in 1910 the natural outlet for Nissum Bay closed and a new one was excavated. However, the new one was too shallow for fishing vessels so, in 1931 the old channel was re-opened but had consequently to be controlled by sluices (including a ship lock). Two jetties were built to protect the entrance from filling up with sediment and then a third was added when the first two were found to be inadequate.  Although erosion increased, the barrier had to be preserved to protect the town of Ringkøbing. The high erosion rates have had the effect of significantly reducing the protection against flooding provided by the dunes and caused loss of valuable recreational areas.									b) Objectives									In 1982, it was decided to implement a coastal protection scheme based on an agreement between municipalities, counties and the state. The policy was to re-establish a safety level against flooding to a 100-year minimum return period, to stop the erosion where towns are situated close to the beach and to reduce erosion on those parts of the coast where future erosion would reduce the safety against flooding to less than 100 years.									6. Implementation of the ICZM Approach (i.e. management, tools, resources)									a) Management									The Danish Coastal Authority (Kystdirektoratet) is a division of the Ministry of Transport and the state advisory body on coastal protection. It is responsible for constructions and maintains state coastal protection on the west coast of Jutland. Other assignments are harbour operation, dredging and storm surge alerts for this coastline and the tidal flats.									b) ICZM tools									Since 1875, groynes have been the major method of coastal defence and ca. 100, built of granite and concrete, have been placed along this coastline. It was not until 1974 that sand nourishment began to be used. A large scale, coastal protection scheme was undertaken 1987-99 to ensure the safety of the coastline. As a result, all that is needed today is maintenance. The following technical measures have been employed:Detached breakwaters: to reduce the nourishment volume needed. 140 breakwaters were constructed.Nourishments: applied to stop the coastline from receding any further whilst recognising that this does not prevent erosion. A specially built vessel is used to draw in sand from the sea bottom ca. 5-10 km from the coast and transport it to the coast where it is coupled to a large rubber hose, after which the sand is pumped offshore onto a sand bar or onto the beach itself. Sand applied to the beach directly acts as standard beach nourishment; that applied underwater to the sand bar acts as a wave-breaker. Little of this sand migrates to the beach. In 2005, the west coast was nourished with ca. 2.4 m. m3 of sand.Revetments: to reach the safety level required but where nourishment was not possible because there was not enough land between the beach and the properties or infrastructure to build a sufficient dune volume. About 25 km. were built in total along the foot of the dunes.									With respect to nourishment, it was found that in the first year, beach nourishment gave a better stabilization of the beach. However, in the longer term, shoreface nourishment is the better option due to a better cost effectiveness, although direct beach nourishment is still required as the additional sand acts as a buffer and prevents erosion of the dunes during storms. 									7. Cost and resources									When the project began the costs were about 20m. DKK/year rising to between 80-90m. DKK by 1997. The expenses are shared between the Danish state, and the affected coastal municipalities.									8. Effectiveness (i.e. were the foreseen goals/objectives of the work reached?)									From 1998,  the very high erosion rates are no longer a fact; on average, it is now only 0.1 m/year. Without coastal protection, an average of 2-4 m. of coast would disappear every year. The safety level of the dunes has been re-established to a level of at least 100 years, the goal set in 1982. The use of breakwaters has reduced the need for nourishment landward of the breakwaters by 50%. The more effective nourishment of the sand bar was also cheaper than nourishment of the beach. The nourishments have been shown to be highly effective since the coastal erosion has been stopped where it was the aim. It also appears, that after a decade, there have been no effects of the measures taken felt outside of the project area. Locally, some leeside erosion still occurs downstream of the detached breakwaters and revetments. There is still uncertainty about the grain size of sand that should be used for maximum effect.									Socio-economically, an additional positive effect is that the beaches have been recovered and can be used for recreational purposes again.									9. Success and Fail factors									There has been a political will and appropriate funding with the necessary administrative institutions in place. There was flexibility in trying to do something new and untried to remedy a century old problem. This entailed ‘learning by doing’ and basing new decisions on the outcome of previous decisions taken (adaptive management). Also knowledge gained in participating in EU-project have been vital.									10. Unforeseen outcomes									In those areas from where the sand is taken, the bottom-fauna. re-established within one year and in the nourished areas within 2-3 years. However, the re-established individuals after one year are smaller in size. 									11. Prepared by									A. H. Pickaver, Coastal &amp; Marine Union (EUCC), The Netherlands 									12.

Overview of the case									The Spanish coastal zone has been analysed to develop a tool to statistically predict the maximum flooding level of  Spanish beaches. This work has been compiled into the Coastal Flood Atlas. The determination of the maximum flood level is essential to develop an adequate long term coastal planning.									5. Context and Objectives									a) Context									The Spanish coast has high ecological and landscape values, and nowadays 32% of the total population is living in coastal areas with the consequent enormous presence of socio-economic activities. 									The problems and issues for which this tool has been developed are related to flood risks on the Spanish coast affecting populations, ecosystems, economic activities and infrastructures. These risks could be associated to climate change effects, such as the increase of sea level rise and extreme events, as well as their frequency of occurrence. The determination of the maximum flooding level in a beach is essential for security reasons, infrastructure design (overtopping, erosion) and for the determination of the Maritime-Terrestrial Public Domain.									This tool has been implemented at the national scale. 									b) Objectives									The goal of the initiative was to develop a methodology to determine the increased flood level in each specific location of the Spanish coast and combine this information with several coastal instrumental databases to finally produce a coastal flood atlas for the Spanish coast.									The specific objectives to be achieved through this tool were (1) to precisely assess the coastal systems dynamics, (2) to reliably design the necessary strategies, (3) to establish a common methodology for the design, execution and monitoring of coastal actions, and (4) to compile in one tool all the Spanish experience in the field of coastal engineering. The timescale associated with implementation and goals achievement was 1 year, 1999.									6. Implementation of the ICZM Approach (i.e. management, tools, resources)									a) Project Management									The Spanish Ministry of Environment promoted and funded the initiative. The University of Cantabria, through its Environmental Hydraulics Institute, conducted the technical design and implementation.									b) ICZM tools									The category of this initiative is a planning and technical tool. 									The Coastal Flood Atlas is an essential technical tool as it determines the maximum flooding level, providing basic information to develop an adequate long term coastal planning considering and promoting the security of populations, ecosystems, economic activities, infrastructures, etc. This tool also helps to protect the future existence of the Maritime-Terrestrial Public Domain by identifying critical areas that require setbacks or any other specific measures. This tool has been based on other specific tools:																																Numerical models that enable us to study coastal processes and assess any changes in a beach due to natural events or human actions on the coast. It includes assessments of  the bathymetric information, wave and dynamics, modal and morphodynamic states, terrain modelling and equilibrium beach, beach morphodynamic evolution, beach cross profile evolution and flood level determination.													Databases with all the required information, including wave and current data, nautical charts, etc.;													Factsheets summarizing the information to understand the prediction for each coastal stretch, resulting in 13 factsheets covering the entire Spanish coast. They include geographical location, wave direction, instrumental information location (buoys, tidal gauge, etc), medium and extreme tidal regimes, medium and extreme beach flood level regimes, etc.																															7. Cost and resources									The budget for this initiative was €150.000. The manpower used for the implementation of the tool was 7 people.									8. Effectiveness (i.e. were the foreseen goals/objectives of the work reached?)									All the defined objectives were achieved in the timescale defined, as a methodology was developed, through the compilation of all the previous Spanish experiences, in order to assess the coastal dynamics and the increased flood level in each specific location of the Spanish coast, and to design the necessary strategies to solve the problem. The Coastal Flood Atlas was created, which is a useful tool for coastal managers as it provides all the needed information to tackle this problem in the long-term as well as providing factsheets to easily handle the information.									9. Success and Fail factors									Factors that were helpful in achieving the objective were: the support and the willingness of the Directorate General for the Coast to develop this tool and the availability of budget and the growing social awareness on climate change and sea level rise effects.									10. Unforeseen outcomes									The Coastal Flood Atlas for the Spanish Coast was awarded the National Environment Award “AQUA” (1999) by the Spanish Ministry of the Environment. Others were  (1) The definition of a methodology to study the coastal processes based on long term assessments; (2) the definition of the corresponding numerical methods and models which are nowadays of common use in Spain; (3) the creation of several databases for the tool, including wave and current data, nautical charts etc.; (4) the initiative was extremely innovative being ahead of its time (the Flood Directive 2007/60/CE required the Member States to assess the flooding risks of their coastal zone and have the results in 2011; Spain already had it in 1999, 12 years before) therefore, Spain automatically fulfilled the Flooding Directive in 2007 as the work was already done.									11.

The total amount of CO2 emitted by maritime transport should also include the contribution from the ports. Many European shipping companies and ports are taking measures to reduce their carbon footprint.									5. Context and Objectives									a) Context									Interestingly there is a complex relationship between climate change and shipping. It can be considered from the point of view of what the maritime industry contributes toward climate change and any mitigation and adaptation that can be achieved with respect to the impact. Alternatively the relationship can be considered in terms of how climate change impacts on the maritime industry, e.g. Extreme weather events, erosion of coastal infrastructure and opening of new sea routes. The International Maritime Organisation (IMO) made Climate Change its Theme for 2009. They published a list of relevant and current documents regarding Climate Change and Shipping. The shipping industry itself is addressing issues such as: Hull, engine and propeller design in an attempt to make shipping more energy efficient. The IMO Ship Energy Efficiency Management Plan is expected to reduce fuel consumption of ships. Previous hopeful proposals ( national and EU) for the use of market-based instruments to reduce ship emissions is proving difficult to implement. There is considerable research being undertaken in the areas of alternative fuels and wind propulsion for ships and many examples of proactive shipping companies pursuing ambitious environmental policies.									b) Objectives									The objectives are for the maritime companies and ports is to reduce their GHG emissions and carbon footprint. Develop methods to mitigate against the maritime transport contributions to climate change. Additionally, the companies and ports need strategies to allow themselves to adapt to climate change to the coast and oceans.									6. Implementation of the ICZM Approach (i.e. management, tools, resources)									a) Management									The management of environmental policy, including the reduction of GHGs, is the responsibility of the individual shipping companies and port authorities. The shipping companies are privately owned, however the port authorities are a mixture of public and private ownership. As an example, The Valencia Port Authority (VPA) is the body responsible for the management and administration of three state-owned ports located along an 80-kilometre stretch of the eastern edge of the Spanish Mediterranean: Sagunto, Valencia and Gandía. 									b) ICZM tools									Various ICZM tools are used according to the type of organisation, operations and location. Some examples are given: 									Wilhelmsen together with their Swedish partner Wallenius in the joint operating car carrier company Wallenius Wilhelmsen, have invested in the design of a concept  &quot;zero emission&quot; ship, E/S Orcelle. It will produce no emissions into either the air or sea and will use renewable energy sources, including the sun, wind and waves, as well as fuel cell technology. Established in 2007, the Orcelle Fund is the philanthropic arm of Wallenius Wilhelmsen Logistics that supports the development of alternative energy initiatives aimed at making shipping more sustainable. Additionally, Wallenius Wilhelmsen logistics are developing an ocean cargo terminal  (Castor) powered by the sun and wind. The terminal has no conventional power, uses no fossil fuels and releases no harmful emissions into the atmosphere. The Castor Green Terminal includes a terminal and vehicle processing centre (VPC), which will handle products such as automotive, agricultural, construction, and other rolling equipment and offers services for receiving and delivery, cargo handling, storage, loading and discharging in a sustainable environment. 									Shipping company AP Moller-Maersk recently won the sustainable shipping operator of the year award by the Petromedia Group. It was praised for the way it challenged conventional wisdom by proving that container ships can save fuel by sailing much slower than traditionally recommended. By halving its top cruising speed over the last two years, Maersk has cut fuel consumption on major routes by as much as 30 percent, greatly reducing costs and achieving an equal cut in the ships’ emissions of greenhouse gases. The Beluga Shipping Company have been forward in exploring different means of propulsion and new shipping routes in response to climate change. Skysails have been developed for cargo ships and Beluga are trialling the systems. Depending on the prevailing wind conditions, a ship’s average annual fuel costs can be reduced by 10 to 35% by using the Skysails-System. Under optimal wind conditions, fuel consumption can temporarily be cut by up to 50%. 									Sea Ports also need to reduce their GHGs and adapt to changes in the coast associated with Climate change. With predicted long-term sea level rises of between 3 to 61cm in the Mediterranean Sea many Mediterranean ports are taken climate change impacts very seriously. The Valencia Port Authority (VPA) is committed to achieving a balance between commercial and economic growth and environmental protection leading to sustainable development. This has led to the creation of an Environmental Policy, approved on 2000 and revised 2006.  The Policy details environmental principles on a general level and those required for improving the port area. These in turn signal the different lines of action taken by the port in the form of environmental actions and/or initiatives. The VPA has integrated its environmental actions into its Strategic Plan in order to fulfil the requirements of its environmental policy. The aim of the Plan is to encourage international competitiveness in economic and social affairs within its area of corporate social responsibility. It fulfils its environmental  objectives by designing tools for controlling and monitoring environmental quality (e.g. air quality, acoustic quality, water quality) and by establishing methodologies that will encourage companies to remain committed to environmentally respectful activities (e.g. Environmental Management Systems). Efforts are also made to identify the training, communication and awareness needs of port users and society in general. 									7. Cost and resources									The private and public organisations fund their research through operational funds and research project funding from various public and private sources.									8. Effectiveness (i.e. were the foreseen goals/objectives of the work reached?)									Wallenius Wilhelmsen Logistics (WWL), a global shipping and logistics company, managed to cut its green house gas emissions by 32% last year. The company also cut its sulphur dioxide emissions (SO2) emissions by 135,000 tonnes in a nine year period from 2000 to 2009.									9. Success and Fail factors									An environment of social responsibility is key to the success of the companies. There is the need to recognise their impact on the environment in general and contribution to climate change in particular. 									10. Unforeseen outcomes									Increasingly, companies are seeing economic advantages in reducing their GHGs, particularly through fuel savings.									11.

Experiences that can be exchanged									Managed realignment is a new way of thinking about improving safety against flooding and creating new environments for Nature and human activities. This method of flood defence creates space - inter-tidal environments such as saltmarsh and mudflats – in which the sea can safely move. This can contribute to the EU Habitats Directive. It can also help in the long term strategy of adapting to sea level rise through natural, inter-tidal mechanisms.									4. Overview of the case									The plan to renovate the old ferry port of Perkpolder has, at its heart, a managed realignment scheme that will create a new Nature area of 75 ha. A new dyke will be built landward of the present dyke with the old dyke maintained but breached. The economy will be strengthened and the quality of life improved.									5. Context and Objectives									a) Context									Until a few years ago, Perkpolder was a busy ferry port on the Westerschelde estuary (southwest Netherlands). Since 2003, the ferry has no longer been used and the port has become deserted. The hinterland is agricultural polders protected from sea flooding by 9-10m high dykes.									b) Objectives									Innovative flood defence is being used to increase safety as well as provide an economic stimulus to the area and improve the standard of living of the community (e.g. aquaculture). It anticipates the option of a primary dike which is resistant to wave splash-over in the future (&gt;50 years) Residential units and recreational areas will be developed against a background of natural saltwater in an area of reduced tidal amplitudes.									6. Implementation of the ICZM Approach (i.e. management, tools, resources)									a) Management									Rijkswaterstaat (Directorate-General for Public Works and Water Management) together with the Municipality of Hulst ,the Province of Zeeland and the District Water Board were responsible for the ICZM approach. The Dutch Forestry Commission, Department for Rural areas and the private sector were  also involved. The Municipality of Hulst and the Province of Zeeland (together with the private sector) are now the lead responsible parties for the commercial parts of the area development of Perkpolder.									b) ICZM Tools									The partners have, together, developed an integrated plan for Perkpolder. There was a great effort made to use new methods for flood protection as part of an integrated, regional, development plan. It embraces three main elements. A new landward dyke will be built west of the current dyke. This latter dyke will then be breached and the area between the two dykes (the Eastern Perkpolder) will be subject to the full tidal flow of the Western Scheldt. This will create a new, brackish, tidal environment (75 ha) which will act as a buffer in front of the new sea-dyke. The old dyke will, therefore, also act as a breakwater for the new dyke. Due to deposition of sediments the height of the salt marsh can keep up with the pace of sea level rise. Thus the sea defences will be strengthened using natural processes.									The old harbour square will be raised to a height of 10m, creating a hill, on which new properties will be built with a view of the Western Scheldt. This area will be safe from currently predicted, rising sea level for the next 200 years. A further, broad flood protection zone, the Western Perkpolder, will be developed on the inland side of the actual dyke. Holiday residential units will be built on artificial hills and the newly developing natural landscape and a golf course provides an opportunity for the possibility of future tolerance to seawater washover instead of raising the dyke.									These new defence measures will also allow choices for further, future safety measures e.g. raising the dyke or strengthening it, to be deferred.									New, entrepreneurial, socio-economic opportunities due to the salt water intrusion will have the time to develop e.g. aquaculture, growing salt-loving vegetables, using floating greenhouses with their own supply of freshwater, growing worms for sea fisheries. It is expected that commercial interests will determine whether these types of activities become popular once it is seen that there is practical, financial gain to be made.									There was stakeholder participation and communication with the local community and relevant stakeholders from the outset. They were involved from the initial, shared analysis through to the final Plan development. Five workshops were held with an independent chairperson. All the parties originally agreed to put their sectoral interest on one side and work with open minds making the process very creative. It was also felt that the public bodies complemented the private organisations well.									There was a cost-benefit analysis carried out which helped the public sector bodies to take the relevant decisions. Work is due to start in 2009 and be completed in 2012.									7. Cost and resources									Costs are estimated at €125m.									8. Effectiveness (i.e. were the foreseen goals/objectives of the work reached?)									This type of coastal defence system has marked advantages over the more common, single line dyke defence system as it allows multi-functional usage.									9. Success and Fail factors									It was felt that all the parties working together from the beginning was a major success factor. The parties also took the time required for a multi-party, decision-making process and to recognise their different, organisational (cultural) differences. 									The development plan was well integrated with new residential units being situated in attractive naturalised, landscapes. This included reserving space for the future since the dyke system has to prevail for 200 years.									The cost-benefit analysis made it clear that the intended development of Nature areas would add to the value of the residential units and recreational opportunities. New jobs would be created in the region. In other words, a broad flood protection zone with a variety of uses would result in a positive balance for society. 									Communication with the local community and relevant stakeholders from the outset was also deemed to be significant to the success of the work.									10. Unforeseen outcomes									None as yet although the time scale would mitigate against seeing such changes at this stage of implementation.									11.

Overview of the case									This case describes the application of a strategic alliance (couplet) between the local authority and a research centre to address the problem of coastal erosion on soft beaches in Donegal (Ireland) and advise on soft engineering approaches. This relationship enhanced capacity of the Council staff in dealing with erosion. A more holistic approach to ICZM was nurtured which represented a move away from traditional, site-focused management.									5. Context and Objectives									a) Context									County Donegal is geographically the most northern county in Ireland. The varied coastline is dominated by long stretches of rocky cliffs interspersed with many sandy beaches and dune systems, estuarine inlets and offshore islands. A number of the county’s sand and dune systems have some form of conservation designation attached. County Donegal is sparsely populated, highly rural, and there are problems of high unemployment, partially due to the demise of the textile industry and to changes in the agricultural sector. Recreational use of the coast has become increasingly important given Donegal’s proximity to Northern Ireland and an attractive exchange rate. Golf courses, caravan parks and holiday homes have proliferated and contributed to, what can only be described as, inappropriate coastal development. This in turn has led to a decline in conservation status, aesthetic quality and amenity value in some locations. Tourism is promoted nationally but remoteness and lack of infrastructure limit its growth potential. 									The issues facing beach managers in Donegal are broad and multi-faceted. Coastal erosion is important with 90% of soft coastline considered at risk and hard coastal defence measures often leading to increased erosion downdrift. There is also a public perception that action should be taken to prevent coastal erosion, despite the fact that it is a natural process in any coastal system. The proliferation of holiday homes and over-development of remote villages has led to increased pressure on infrastructure, such as water services and sewerage systems, as well as incompatible user conflicts.									b) Objectives									The main aims of the expert couplet, in recent times, are to: appraise the potential viability and scope of a proposed regional coastal management centre; give advice to Council engineers on the use of soft engineering approaches to coastal erosion; and provide research to assess the nature of coastal erosion leading to the development of an appropriate management strategy. The strategic advice would reflect the adoption of a more holistic and less site-focused approach to ICZM.									6. Implementation of the ICZM Approach (i.e. management, tools, resources)									a) Management									Donegal County Council is the local authority responsible for development planning and control, housing, road improvement and maintenance, pollution control, water services and community development. As with the majority of coastal local authorities in Ireland, the Council also assume the role of de facto coastal managers. More recently the Council has taken a proactive role in developing sectors that may contribute to addressing unemployment, in particular, marine and coastal recreation, tourism development and value-added food processing. The Centre for Coastal &amp; Marine Research (CCMR) of the University of Ulster, Coleraine, leads the research and provides advice.									b) ICZM tools									A multi-disciplinary approach was used to improve understanding of the links between physical coastal processes and human activities. In the first instance this culminated in devising alternative management plans for seven beach study sites including studies of public opinion and perception as well as the existing legal and administrative frameworks for beach management. These subsequently became part of the Council’s overall spatial plan at a strategic level. Dissemination of the lessons learned was achieved by the Council’s publication of a coastal management good practice guide.  Though the studies were site specific, the academic couplet used the context of the relationship to develop awareness within the Council of the need for a more holistic, strategic approach to coastal planning and management, supported by evidence. This was done in a gradual process between the personnel involved at a personal level. 									In Autumn 1997 the University established its MSc programme in coastal zone management. Significantly, one of the first graduates of this masters course was later employed by Donegal County Council in a defined coastal management role, one of the very first such appointments by any local authority in Ireland. This appointment led to even closer links between the Council and the University Following this appointment links between CCMR and DCC continued formally in a number of different ways, the first involved an assessment of a planning proposal application to build a golf course in 1998, another was a study of the erosion status and management options of all soft shorelines on the Inishowen Peninsula (2002) while a comparative cross-border study of beach management practices in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland took place in 2003. Eventually, the need for an ICZM framework at the County level was inculcated among the most senior and influential officers within the Local Authority and a major outcome of all of these interactions was the inclusion of ICZM objectives in Donegal’s County Development Plan and County Strategy.  									To help build capacity within the council a two-day training course, regarding Couplet mechanisms and ICZM was run for staff of the Council with a coastal remit. The need for more informed decision making also led to the council to fund a three year PhD study on coastal erosion and management at seven different coastal sites. This now provides them with scientific backing for future management decisions. The couplet is now progressing work on a local climate change adaptation strategy for the Donegal region and aims to provide research which can feed into a future Maritime Spatial Plan for a pilot area in Donegal.									7. Cost and resources									No information is available.									8. Effectiveness (i.e. were the foreseen goals/objectives of the work reached?)									The CCMR encouraged the Council to adopt a more holistic and less site-focused ICZM approach. This proved the Couplet to be a mechanism to influence management at a strategic level and enhance management capacity in the local authority. In recent years, the Donegal Couplet specifically facilitated the use of soft engineering approaches to coastal erosion, addressing both regional and local scale coastal erosion, sea defence and effects of sea level rise. As the Council staff have habitually sought informal advice from the research centre since the EU Demonstration Programme on ICZM, even outside the scope of the projects, their own capacity to manage the coast has been continuously developed.  									9. Success and Fail factors									The fact that the link between this couplet pair dates back for more than a decade, as they had previously worked informally together on the ICZM Demonstration Programme and later on as consultant/client relationship, built up familiarity and trust between the persons/institutions involved. One of the main differences between the previous types of relationship and the formal interactive Couplet is the fact that the nature and broadness of focus of the latter provided a mechanism to influence management at a strategic level. Another important difference is that the current relationship enhanced management capacity in the local authority, whereas the previous had only limited influence. 									In the Republic of Ireland, there is no single entity with responsibility for policy setting and implementation of coastal management. The decision to engage in the approach here described did not emerge from Council policy but it was individual, insightful Council employees that paved the way for action. Donegal County Council had previously frequently engaged external consultants to undertake technical work, particularly in coastal issues, as in-house expertise in this area was limited.									10. Unforeseen outcomes									There was a two way transfer of knowledge: the research group obtained an improved understanding of ICZM constraints in an operational context. The influence of the Couplet also helped lead to the appointment of a beach manager as part of a beach recreational strategy which was considered a key outcome.									11. Prepared by									J.M.

Overview of the case									The natural conditions of erosion were analysed, socio-economic status and measures to protect the west coast of the island Sylt from erosion were assessed. Sand nourishment was found to be an efficient way to protect the west coast from a further decline. It does not prevent erosion, thus sand nourishments have to be repeated when necessary because the sand depot has been depleted by storm surges. 									5. Context and Objectives									a) Context									Sylt is a sandy barrier island in the North Sea. It is the most northern of the German Wadden Sea islands. The coastal zone is characterised by sand dunes, and at the west coast by sand dune cliffs (up to 35 m high, flattening towards the south) and sand beaches in front of the cliffs, that break some of the oncoming wave energy. Nonetheless, the 40 km west coast is very vulnerable to erosion. The east coast borders the Wadden Sea tidal flats. 									Tides have an amplitude of 2 metres. Wave and tidal action continuously erode shore and foreshore and transport sediments to the northern and southern end, respectively, depositing them there (structural erosion). Severe storm surges even affect the cliffs and the Wadden sea side. Since 1928 the island is connected to the mainland by a railway dam. Both sides of the dam are sediment sinks where salt marshes are growing. About 21,000 people live on the islands 99 km2 (density 212 inhabitants/km2). The entire Wadden Sea is protected as a national park and biosphere reserve. Besides nature conservation the island is an important sea-side tourism and recreation spot. Fisheries and urbanisation are other factors that determine the island''s characteristics. Damage to the coastal protection threatens the island properties. High population density and high economic values define a high risk potential in the central cities, the other parts are at moderate risk, though the recreational value is high. Therefore, current policies are “hold the line”. Recently, due to climate change scientific debates about a policy change towards a “protect-selected-area-strategy” started. 									b) Objectives									The aim was to define affordable and efficient long-term protection of the west coast of the sand barrier island Sylt from the loss of values considering the different interests. Best practises for long-term coastal protection considering climate change effects were to be described. 									6. Implementation of the ICZM Approach (i.e. management, tools, resources)									a) Management									Today, sand nourishments are organized by the State Agency for Costal Protection, National Park, and Marine Protection (Landesbetrieb für Küstenschutz, Nationalpark und Meeresschutz Schleswig-Holstein) as the executing agency of the Ministry of Agriculture, Environment, and Rural Areas. 									b) ICZM tools									The description of the risk situation and the analysis of the efficiency of different coastal protection measures can be used as a decision-helping tool for island communities and planners. The assessment study was based on an indicator list. For the development of policy recommendations a pressure-state-impact-response (PSIR) approach was adopted. The different measures analysed were solid constructions, bank revetment, groynes and sand nourishment. Sand nourishment had been started in 1972 in Westerland, since 1984 it is done along the whole west coast. Additional bio-technological measures to increase the stability of the dunes are the erection of sand trap fences and the planting of marram grass. The hard constructions had not stopped constant erosion, on the contrary wave reflexion on the walls and revetments increased beach erosion. 									The status of the socio-economic situation and the different interests were taken into consideration. Also, regional interests were considered, since erosion, sediment-transport, and coastal protection measures can affect neighbouring islands as well due to changes in currents and sediment load. Sand nourishment turned out to be appropriate solution from a technical, economic, and environmental point of view. It does protect the coast line from decline, though it has to be repeated as soon as the artificial sand stocks are depleted. The sand is excavated with an automated suction dredge device from an area about 10 km west of the island shore from a depth of 14 m. At first, ships pump the sand to near-shore and fore-dune sand deposits. At high tides the sand is moved further up the beach with the help of shovel excavators and tubing. The sand nourishment activities are accompanied by sonar measurements of the near-shore seafloor and on the beach before and after nourishment activities. The deposits need to be replenished regularly. Each autumn the beach profile is measured by laser scanning from an airplane. No impact of the sand dredging on the island has yet been registered. However, long-term effects of sand extraction are not well known. Neighbouring regions are not affected by the activities. Sand nourishment creates wide sandy beaches increasing the recreational value. 									7. Cost and resources									In 2008, 1.3 million m3 of sand were moved to replenish the deposits for a length of 5.7 km. This cost €6 million. 									8. Effectiveness (i.e. were the foreseen goals/objectives of the work reached?)									Sand nourishment started in 1972 and has been repeated at irregular or regular intervals. Hard structure protection of the west coast has been found ineffective in the long run. Even some negative effects have been noticed. The tetrapod groyne in the south protects the coast north of it but increases erosion downstream. The seawall at Westerland needs to be nourished to protect it from collapsing, and it causes lee-side erosion. The sand system of beach, fore-beach, and dune is kept intact by the sand nourishment and bio-technological measures. On the Wadden Sea side, storm surges lead to long lasting damage with poor recovery.           									9. Success and Fail factors									Policies to “hold the line” by means of dykes started to falter in the 1950s. The policy changed to ensure similar security for all state dykes instead of building new ones. However, hard construction measures and engineering still dominated coastal defence policies until the 1980s. In the 1990s this attitude changed to use soft techniques based on more natural materials, such as sand nourishment. In 1995, a common salt marsh management plan was introduced by coastal defence and environmental authorities. Risk management will develop towards calculating risk from the probability of the occurrences of protection damage and the potential damage caused by a resulting flooding. Within the initiative “Coastal Protection of Sylt”, initiated by the managing state agency in Husum, an analysis of the latest developments and technologies in coastal protection had already been conducted and found sand nourishment an appropriate means. The “Generalplan Küstenschutz” (Coastal Protection Master Plan) stated costs of the measures that could be taken into the efficiency analysis in terms of costs and outcomes. 									10. Unforeseen outcomes									Long-term effects of sand extraction are not well known. Solid protection measures were shown to fail on the long run and even had negative side effects such as increased lee-erosion. 									11. Prepared by									Priv.-Doz. Dr. habil.

Overview of the case									Shabla municipality took the conscious decision to compromise part of its coastal landscape in favour of hard rock measures to protect the coast from severe annual erosion. Various structures were built to safeguard the coastline and ensure the livelihoods of the local communities. The measures proved effective to ‘’hold the line’’ and the increased safety has allowed other economic activities to develop e.g. eco-tourism .									5. Context and Objectives									a) Context									The area of Shabla community covers the northern-most Bulgarian coastal municipality. It borders Romania to the north, the Black Sea to the east, Kavarna municipality to the south and General Toshevo municipality to the west. The area of the municipality is 330km2 and constitutes 5.6% of the coastal zone of the country. The population of the municipality is 6,900 in 16 settlements, the chief ones being Durankulak, Krapetz and Ezeretz. The main economic activities are agriculture (85%), industry (5%) and tourism (3%). The negative impacts of erosion are loss of fertile land and crops, loss of tourism sites including accommodation and tourism infrastructure and loss of protected coastal areas and landscape diversity									The Bulgarian land-use plan approved in 1997 is the most effective tool for territorial and coastal management which incorporates the main ICZM principles. The development of the municipality is planned in two directions, agricultural production on one side and expanding coastal tourism and recreation, including spa facilities using the rich ‘medicinal’ muds and hydro-mineral resources, on the other. Coastal erosion is one of the most important problems. Because of its geological character, it is vulnerable and suffers constant, significant losses of fertile land and landscape. The main factors for coastal erosion in the area are chronic sea abrasion 35 to 140 cm/yr., periodic storms (the maximum rate of cliff abrasion is 700 cm/yr. and surface and linear erosion (18cm/yr). Human activities contributing to erosion are negligible, because there is little economic development along the coast.									The main policy option used is hard measures but to create multi-functional uses to accommodate an expanding tourist industry.									b) Objectives									To ‘hold the line’ but, at the same time to create a multi-functional use of the coast and, in particular, to accommodate an expanding tourist industry.									6. Implementation of the ICZM Approach (i.e. management, tools, resources)									a) Management									The Ministry of Regional Development is responsible for overall coastal defence. Implementation of the coastal defence actions is by the local municipality.									b) ICZM tools									For Cape Shabla, a comprehensive,  coastal protection, urban plan together with a construction project was ordered by the municipality for the villages including  the facilities and a small port (used by both fishermen and recreational yachts) and the necessary infrastructure. To the north of Shabla, this consisted of a rocky embankment protection dyke (200m long), a low jetty (40m long), a high pier (110m long), a concrete wall (105m long) and a berth (125m long). To the south of Shabla, the construction works consisted of a rocky embankment protection dyke (250m long). The fishermen’s village now has berths for 113 boats, 44 yachts and 6 motorised cutters for local tourism trips.									In the case of Krapetz bay, coastal protection and a small port for fishermen, yachts and local tourism purposes entailed the construction of two concrete walls (560m &amp; 258m long), two dykes (693m &amp; 258m long) and two jetties (85m &amp; 31m long).									7. Cost and resources									This National Investment Program for Landslide Coastal Fortification cost €603 million for the five year period 1999-2003 inclusive.									8. Effectiveness (i.e. were the foreseen goals/objectives of the work reached?)									The protection measures have been effective and the erosion process has stopped. The main goals have, therefore, been achieved viz. the losses of the shoreline have stopped, the risks to the population and the capital investments have decreased and the interests of the local community have been adequately protected. So far, no negative effects on the coast in neighbouring sections have been observed. Maintenance expenses are very low. 									For Krapetz, the existing wall is located directly before the village and the effects are clear - erosion has stopped, the roads and houses near to the shore are safe and a small park has been developed. There is no change in the quality of the beach in front of the wall, and no serious changes in the sea bottom near the beach. Following dyke construction, the shoreline stopped its landward movement, the near shore landslides ceased and there has been no more loss of fertile agricultural land. This is in contrast to the remaining, unprotected part of the bay, where the erosion process is still very active and loss of the fertile land poses a significant threat for the local community. 									Socio-economically, the safety of the investments in tourism, fisheries and industry as well as the increased safety of the environmental values and decreased losses in tourism,  fisheries and agriculture has increased the standard of living of the local population e.g. the perspectives for eco-tourism have increased in the areas of cultural and historic heritage, rural tourism and diving.									9. Success and Fail factors									There was an initial, international cooperation with Denmark leading to a Danish-Bulgarian ICZM Planning project as early as 1992. This was followed by the Bulgarian ICZM Programme supported by the Bulgarian government in which the Black Sea Environmental Programme also developed an ICZM component. The Shabla municipality was involved in all these programmes and projects and it now has an up-to-date territorial management plan where all future developments and sectoral strategies are integrated.									There is still a necessity for permanent monitoring of the environment and the effects of the coastal protection measures and facilities although the finances for these activities are lacking.									10. Unforeseen outcomes									The most negative effects are connected with the aesthetics because the concrete walls and the stony dykes are not compatible with the normal natural landscapes in this area. However, a conscious decision was taken to compromise the natural landscapes in favour of the coastal protection facilities.									11. Prepared by									A. H.

Overview of the case									This initiative was launched by the Asturian Government as a contribution to the European Commission Maritime Policy Green Paper.  It aims to design a sustainable socio-economic development model for the Asturian coast, through a coherent and participative framework, the optimisation of financial resources, the integration of the project within the maritime Atlantic area and the maritime policies integrated management. 									5. Context and Objectives									a) Context									Asturias is a small autonomous community (10,500 km2) located on the north Spanish coast facing the Cantabrian Sea and with the Cantabrian Mountains as the natural border to the south. In the eastern range, the Picos de Europa National Park contains the highest mountains, rising to 2,648 m. The key features of Asturian geography are its rugged coastal cliffs and the mountainous interior. The coastline (334 km) is extensive, with hundreds of sandy beaches bordered by steep cliffs, coves and natural sea caves. Coastal populations are very linked to the sea through an ancestral maritime tradition (which left important historical heritage sites), along with other economic activities such as agriculture, farming, fisheries, tourism, transport and industry. Although the Austurian coast is quite well preserved, a high percentage of the total population lives there, putting pressure on the different socio-economic activities, infrastructures, second housing etc. The MAREA Strategy was created to tackle these territorial pressures in an integrated way. The tool was implemented at the regional scale. Previous management processes that helped or pushed the MAREA Strategy forward were the PORNA (Asturian Natural Resources Management Plan) and the POLA (Asturian Coastal Management Plan, 2005).									b) Objectives									The MAREA Strategy has 6 general objectives and 17 specific objectives. (1) Environmental objective: (1.1) Preserving and recovering the coastal and marine resources; (1.2) improving maritime and terrestrial spatial planning and management. (2) Economic objective: (2.1) increasing competitiveness of the maritime sector, (2.2) boosting the new sustainable economic activities, (2.3) researching the potential of new sustainable activities. (3) Socio-cultural objective: (3.1) generating local employment, (3.2) maintaining cultural identity, (3.3) improving the services for local population and visitors. (4) R+D+I Objective: (4.1) researching on maritime topics and integration into public policies, (4.2) integrating the scientific and technical knowledge in the maritime sector, (4.3) promoting innovation. (5) Training and awareness Objective: (5.1) improving training in the maritime sector, (5.2) creating new employment opportunities for coastal population, (5.3) increasing social awareness on the importance of coastal and marine resources. (6) Innovative Public Management Model Design: (6.1) Maritime Policy Management System Certification (UNE, EN, ISO), (6.2) Public Contracting under MAREA criteria, (6.3) MAREA statistical data and indicators.									The Strategy was developed in 9 months (October 2006-June 2007), and the timescale associated with the implementation and goals achievement is 6 years (2007-2013). 									6. Implementation of the ICZM Approach (i.e. management, tools, resources)									a) Project Management									This initiative was launched by the Asturian Government as a contribution to the European Commission Maritime Policy Green Paper. Información y desarollo S.L. (Infyde). A Spanish consulting firm based in Bilbao and specialised in the design and implementation of territorial development and regional innovation strategies in Spain, contributed to the development of the Strategy. The development of the Strategy has involved all the coastal stakeholders including socio-economic actors and competent sectoral institutions at the local, regional, national and European levels. All the Administrations at these 4 levels have formed the Project Management Committee.									b) ICZM tools									This initiative is a planning tool. The specific tools applied are the following:					                					Previous spatial planning instruments, such as (1) the PORNA (Asturian Natural Resources Management Plan) which designed a natural protected areas network which  resulted in 73% of the Asturian coast being subjected to protection (Nature 2000 network, Ramsar wetlands, OSPAR Convention, and natural/regional figures); and (2) the POLA (Asturian Coastal Management Plan, 2005), which among other initiatives, established a 500m wide “coastal protection-non urban area” stretch in the entire region, except in the existing urban areas whose growth has been, from this point on, oriented inland.Maritime Governance and Decision-making structure (at the regional level), based on a clear political leadership (Government Delegate Commission for Maritime Affairs), scientific knowledge (Scientific Committee), and public participation (Asturian Maritime Forum).The Government Delegate Commission for Maritime Affairs is composed of the Regional Government representatives with competences on maritime affairs and assisted by a Technical Board. Its functions are co-ordinating initiatives and facilitating relationships with external maritime institutions (EU, etc)The Scientific Committee is composed of experts on different marine-related fields, from both the public and private sector, such as universities, research centres, administrations, etc. Its functions are advising the competent administrations in the decision-making, and participating/integrating in similar organisms at the European and international levelThe Asturian Maritime Forum is composed of all the social and economic regional actors which have been involved in the development of the regional maritime strategy since the beginning of the process to encourage a consensus-based resultPolicies and stakeholders integration mechanisms (at the national and European level):Proposal (National level) for an effective sectoral co-ordination and the elaboration of Joint Plans of Action with the interested Autonomous Communities.Proposal (National level) for a Collaboration General Protocol with the Autonomous Communities for the establishment of an administrative and methodological framework on maritime policy.Proposal (European level) for collaboration - Tripartite Agreement or European Territorial Agreement- between Region, State and European Union, as the adequate tool to optimise a coherent decision-making.Proposal (European level) of Transnational Maritime Advisory Council and Maritime Scientific Committees.Public participation and consultation processes throughout the strategy development, in order to promote a consensus-based approach. All the interested stakeholders were involved through public debates and written communications, promoting a strong transparency in the process. Over 250 people have been involved.                    									7. Cost and resources									The budget for the diagnosis and strategy planning tasks of this initiative was €.100,000 This includes the sub-contracting of a consulting firm to carry out the diagnosis and the costs related to the organisation of public participation meetings. The implementation of the action plan has not received additional funding but available resources have been re-directed to this task. Information concerning the manpower used for the implementation of the tool is not available.									8. Effectiveness (i.e. were the foreseen goals/objectives of the work reached?)									The Strategy has been created integrating previous approaches (like POLA and PORNA) and promoting a sustainable socio-economic development model based on participative processes and maritime governance. The specific outcomes must be assessed at the end of the implementation period (2013).									9. Success and Fail factors									Factors that were helpful in achieving the objective were: (1) the awareness of the Asturian Government of the need for an integrated approach in coastal and marine issues, (2) the willingness of the Asturian Government to participate and contribute: it belonged to the Peripheral Maritime Regions of Europe (CPMR) and participated in the public debate about the EC Maritime Policy Green Paper. Others were (3) that the previous (but still in force) tools -POLA and PORNA- were based on an in-depth debate and dialogue between administrations that required long elaboration and approval periods due to the several public participation processes carried out, and (4) the boost that several external actors have given to maritime affairs since 2005, such as the European Commission and the Peripheral Maritime Regions of Europe (CPMR).									Obstacles in achieving the objective are related to the difficulties in implementing the administrative structure in order to execute an effective policy and stakeholder integration. Also the lack of willingness of both the European Commission and the Spanish Government to formalize the Tripartite Agreement as a political action tool.									10. Unforeseen outcomes									The document has been valued by the EC and the Conference of Peripheral Maritime Regions of Europe (CPMR) as an example of good practices at the European level. 									11.

To take the right actions, decision makers, businesses and citizens must be provided with reliable and up-to-date information on how our planet and its climate are changing. The European Earth observation programme GMES (Global Monitoring for Environment and Security) provides this information. 

Policymakers and public authorities, the major users of GMES, will use the information to prepare environmental legislation and policies with a particular focus on Climate Change, monitor their implementation and assess their effects. GMES also supports the critical decisions that need to be made quickly during emergencies, such as when natural or man-made catastrophes and humanitarian crises occur. 

Users will be provided with information through services dedicated to a systematic monitoring and forecasting of the state of the Earth''s subsystems. Six thematic areas are developed: marine, land, atmosphere, emergency, security and climate change. A land monitoring service, a marine monitoring service and an atmosphere monitoring service contribute directly to the monitoring of climate change and to the assessment of mitigation and adaptation policies.

To take the right actions, decision makers, businesses and citizens must be provided with reliable and up-to-date information on how our planet and its climate are changing. The European Earth observation programme GMES (Global Monitoring for Environment and Security) provides this information. 

Policymakers and public authorities, the major users of GMES, will use the information to prepare environmental legislation and policies with a particular focus on Climate Change, monitor their implementation and assess their effects. GMES also supports the critical decisions that need to be made quickly during emergencies, such as when natural or man-made catastrophes and humanitarian crises occur. 

Users will be provided with information through services dedicated to a systematic monitoring and forecasting of the state of the Earth''s subsystems. Six thematic areas are developed: marine, land, atmosphere, emergency, security and climate change. A land monitoring service, a marine monitoring service and an atmosphere monitoring service contribute directly to the monitoring of climate change and to the assessment of mitigation and adaptation policies. Two additional GMES services address respectively emergency response (e.g. floods, fires, technological accidents, humanitarian aid) and security-related aspects (e.g. maritime surveillance, border control). GMES services are all designed to meet common data and information requirements and have global dimension. 

In practice, GMES consists in a complex set of systems which collects data from multiple sources (earth observation satellites and in situ sensors such as ground stations, airborne and sea-borne sensors), processes these data and provides users with reliable and up-to-date information through the services mentioned above. Some of these systems and data sources already exist today, as well as prototype services but many developments are still required in all domains.', '', '', '', '', NULL, NULL, NULL, 'AGRICULTURE;BIODIVERSITY;COASTAL;DISASTERRISKREDUCTION;FINANCIAL;HEALTH;INFRASTRUCTURE;MARINE;WATERMANAGEMENT;', 'OBSERVATIONS;', '');

Overview of the case									An economically important tourist area in southern Sweden is threatened by coastal erosion. The case shows the ‘hold the line’ measures which have been taken to ensure that there is no loss of the tourist income. The policy measure shows a benefit:cost ratio of 3:1 against doing nothing to protect the shoreline.									5. Context and Objectives									a) Context									Ystad is located in the southern point of Sweden and, although Sweden is generally subject to land uplift by isostatic rebound, notable erosion occurs here where land uplift is around zero. An important part of the city of Ystad is Sandskogen which has a coastal, sandy beach strip of about 5 kilometres. The area within, and around, Sandskogen is of great archaeological interest with many settlements and findings from the Mesolithic period (10000 – 4000 B.C.) Over the last 100 years, the coastline has moved about 50 meters inland. It is vital for the tourist economy of Ystad (population 26,000) that the erosion of the coast does not continue. In 2004, around one million tourists visited Ystad (1600 hotel beds and 650 camping places) spending ca. €48 million.  Ystad is also one of the seaports of Sweden on the southern Baltic coast. Its artificial harbour, which admits vessels drawing 6 m., is freer from ice in winter than any other Swedish Baltic port. At Löderups Strandbad, there is a nature reserve. The combination of high water levels with strong wind has on many occasions resulted in severe damage of the coast of Ystad municipality. 									b) Objectives									The present strategy of Ystad municipality is to “Hold the line” with  a ”Limited intervention” to preserve the present position of the coastline.									6. Implementation of the ICZM Approach (i.e. management, tools, resources)									a) Management									Coastal planning is mainly the responsibility of the municipalities, although for some special sector planning the region or even national level is responsible. The coordination of the different state sector interests in the physical plans of the municipalities is the responsibility of the County Administrative Board. This body develops regional guidelines and has to ensure that national and regional policies are considered in local planning. 									b) ICZM tools									In order to safeguard their plots, the owners in the area have dumped rocks/bricks along the coast since the 1950’s. The Swedish Environmental Protection Agency decided to support an effort by the local municipality Ystad in 1995 to halt the erosion following several decades of serious erosion. As a part of this programme, a series of groynes were constructed along the coast. At Sandskogen, in front of the hotel, a seawall of 300 m length was built. The edge, in front of the hotel, is very steep and stones have been laid there to delay/mitigate further erosion. Just east of the hotel four groynes with a length of 100 m were built during the 50’s and 60’s and in 1995 one additional groyne was established immediately east of the hotel. The dunes were strengthened by placing geo-textile and planting vegetation in one section, and west of that another seawall was built with a length of about 1000 m. Other works have been conducted viz. at Löderups Strandbad, two groynes were built in 1994, 800 m apart and another four were subsequently built later on.  Ystad’s main sewage drain has earlier been threatened with destruction so a 200 m long seawall was built. The opportunity was taken to test various materials and construction types for the seawall to see which works best for future defences. The three applied construction types were 1. solid concrete (foreshore protection), 2 gabions (net baskets with stone filling) and 3 concrete slabs attached, forming a net. In front of the coastal protection slope, two smaller groynes have been built at an angle with the coast. Following this work, at the request of the community a camera monitoring system for the beach was established									In general, in Sweden beach nourishment is very unusual for coastal protection. However, the municipality has applied for, and been granted,  permission to extract sand from accumulating areas to nourish the eroding parts of the Sandskogen beach both in the water and on the beach. A request to extract sand from the seafloor was rejected. A social cost-benefit analysis of the area was conducted which indicates that the benefits of maintaining and protecting the present shoreline under the current policy is economically more than 3 times more beneficial than the cost of doing nothing.									Following the HELCOM recommendation 15/1 (protection of the coastal strip), a protected shoreline zone ranging 100 m inland and offshore is reserved for out-door recreation and nature protection and may be extended to 300 m if necessary.									7. Cost and resources									No costs are available.									8. Effectiveness (i.e. were the foreseen goals/objectives of the work reached?)									The overall effect of the entire coastal protection scheme is positive in Ystad. The early dumping of rocks by the owners at Löderups Strandbad temporary saved the buildings but, in the long run the ad hoc way in which the dumping had occurred resulted in much graver damages and more problems. In some areas, the problem has been moved further downstream because only hard protections were applied. The coastal protection scheme has protected the beaches from erosion thus preserving the recreational facilities of the coast. The dunes have also been strengthened reducing the chances of flooding. The existing seawalls and promenades that have been built need constant maintenance. If this is not done, the prevailing weather situations will lead to flooding and renewed, progressive erosion leading to loss of large beach areas. Considering the predicted sea level rise over the next 100 years due to global warming, protection of the shoreline and land areas close to the sea is becoming more acute. 									9. Success and Fail factors									An Environmental Code was drawn up with the purpose of creating stronger environmental legislation. Furthermore, the measures taken are underpinned by fifteen national environmental quality objectives which were adopted in 1999. These comprise i.a. “a balanced marine environment, sustainable coastal areas and archipelagos”, “that sea and coast must have a high degree of biological diversity, opportunities for aesthetic experiences and natural and cultural values” and “Industrial activities and recreations shall be carried out in a way that promotes sustainable development”. Monitoring programmes on coastal protection schemes are, however, lacking.									10. Unforeseen outcomes									Because only hard protection types were applied, the erosion problem has been moved further downstream in some areas of the coastal protection scheme. However, in these areas the problems are deemed to be less urgent because of the absence of important infrastructure or recreational facilities.									11. Prepared by									A. H. Pickaver, Coastal &amp; Marine Union (EUCC), The Netherlands 									12. Verified by									It was not possible to have this case verified.									13.

Context and Objectives									a) Context									Pressures on the coastal zone have considerably increased over the last decades in Finland, mainly as a result of holiday homes. Three coastal regions, Uusimaa, Itä-Uusimaa and Kymenlaakso cover 15000 km2 of land areas and 1000 km2 of water areas.  The coastline of these regions is 9075 km long. One and half million people live in the coastal regions, nearly a third of the Finnish population. Human activities put a high pressure on land use development. Detailed land use plans for coastal areas are needed covering, in particular, the protection of natural resources of national and European interest. One characteristic of the Finnish work is that it is also a response to the promulgation in 1997 of the law on nature conservation which requires land use plans for the coastal strip. 									b) Objectives									The project was part of the EU ICZM Demonstration programme. Its main goal was to promote master planning in the coastal zone of the Gulf of Finland as an innovative exercise representing a joint planning process between local and regional administrations. 									6. Implementation of the ICZM Approach (i.e. management, tools, resources)									a) Management									The seven municipalities involved in the project were: Tammisaari, Inkoo., Porvoo, Pernaja, Ruotsinpyhtää, Pyhtää and Virolahti. The lead was taken by Uusimaa Regional Environmental Centre  and the Ministry of the Environment.									b) ICZM  tools									Finland''s land use planning system, as defined in the Land use and Building Act, gives municipalities a high degree of autonomy in local land use planning. Municipal planning is guided by national land use guidelines from the national government, and by regional land use plans by Regional Councils. In a coastal strip of 100 – 200 m land zone there is an obligation for the preparation of spatial planning through which restrictions can be put to building. In addition, all natural ecosystems in the coastal zone are protected by law. The initiative was expected to integrate new methodologies and tools in the planning procedure: environmental impact assessment (EIA), Geographic Information Systems (GIS) and participatory planning. It also had the task to develop co-operation networks with other Baltic Sea nations and promote joint management of coastal areas. Basic ICZM tools are the preparation of general land use plans for the management of coastal areas; implementation of existing regional plans; contribution of the setting up of the Natura 2000 network; EIA as a part of the planning process; and participatory planning. The Gulf of Finland work recommended that integrated planning should be undertaken at the regional and local level during the preliminary phase of ICZM.  Land use planning is one means for realising development goals and could considerably extend master planning on the southern coast and the islands.									7. Cost and resources									Synergy was gained from the joint co-operation, which makes this approach recommendable for use in other areas. However, more resources are needed, including state support for drawing up plans for the most valuable coastal zones. To maintain the biodiversity of coastal zones and to develop coasts in a sustainable way, more discussion is needed to reconcile the development goals of various sectors. 									8. Effectiveness (i.e. were the foreseen goals/objectives of the work reached?)									 The project was funded by EU Life Environment. Total costs were approximately €600,000.									9. Success and Fail factors									Responsibilities for designation and management of protected areas often rests at a regional level while land use planning is more typically a local function. The Gulf of Finland has facilitated exchange of ideas and information between the seven municipalities working in parallel to develop local coastal management plans in an informal way. The building act requires plans for shorefront development; the problem is that ''everyman''s right'' (free access to the coast for all) inevitably leads to multiple recreational activities in natural areas which can produce certain land use conflicts. The planning system is proving adequate to address the two major concerns in the area (conservation, summerhouses) but will not be sufficient alone to deal with socio-economic issues arising from the relative isolation of the area and heavy seasonality of its usage. However, extensive change of knowledge and intensive co-operation between stakeholders were some important success factors. Especially the contribution of school children, who got an opportunity to participate in a drawing competition, succeeded well and is applicable also to other projects.   									10.

These will describe the evolution of the Earth system components by seamlessly combining two different but complementary approaches: regional observation datasets of Essential Climate Variables (ECVs) on the one hand and model based regional reanalysis on the other. 
The project will extend, in a cost effective manner, European capacity to systematically monitor climate variability and change (including extremes) on a range of space and time scales.  EURO4M will reach out with innovative and integrated data products and climate change services to policy-makers, researchers, planners and citizens at European, national and local levels. This will directly address the needs of, for instance, the European Environment Agency for their environmental assessment reports - and even provide online reporting during emerging extreme events. As the primary source of timely, targeted and reliable information about the state of the climate in Europe, the suggested collaborative project is an important building block for GMES. 

The project will integrate and extend core services activities on ECVs, specifically developing the capacity required for state-of-the-art user-oriented products for monitoring of climate change. EURO4M has the potential to evolve into a future GMES service on climate change monitoring that is fully complimentary and supporting the existing operational services.

Overview of the case									The development of saltmarsh, in an area opened up to tidal inundation by the breaching of 3km of hard sea defences to realign the shoreline. It has created nationally important habitat provided a more sustainable approach to flood defence. 									5. Context and Objectives									a) Context									Abbotts Hall Farm Estate is situated along the 6 km long tributary of the Blackwater Estuary in Essex. This estuary is one of the largest in East Anglia. The 287 ha. site used to be protected by a 3.5km stretch of sea wall requiring constant, costly maintenance. It was built 300-400 years ago. The land behind the wall was largely high-grade agricultural land and the economic justification for continuing to maintain such a wall was negligible. A cost-benefit analysis identified that the preferred option was not to maintain this defence.									Choosing where to locate the realignment was difficult, Abbotts Hall was chosen because height above sea level was the critical element and funds were available to implement the scheme. Saltmarsh will not develop if the land to be inundated is at the wrong level. If it is too low, mudflats develop, while if it is too high  the inundation does not take place and erosion can occur. Although mudflats provide a natural form of sea defence and a valuable habitat for invertebrates and birds, it can be perceived as an eyesore and risks losing public acceptance. Land that does not flood defeats the point of the exercise. 									b) Objectives									The aim was to create a more sustainable coastal defence. By absorbing wave and tidal current energies saltmarsh can provide a natural flood defence. Moreover, managed realignment of the coastline can moderate tidal surges by creating space for the tidal surge to move into allowing them to move sideways, thus alleviating pressure on flood defences elsewhere in the system. It is anticipated that the saltmarsh created at Abbotts Hall and the rising ground behind the saltmarsh zone will, together, provide a ‘soft and flexible’ defence better able to respond to future sea level rise than the existing fixed, hard structures. The development of saltmarsh, in the area opened up to tidal inundation by the breaching of some 3km of hard sea defences to realign the shoreline, will create nationally important habitat and provide a significant contribution to the national Biodiversity Action Plan (BAP) targets for saltmarsh creation. 									6. Implementation of the ICZM Approach (i.e. management, tools, resources)									a) Management									Essex Wildlife Trust purchased the Abbotts Hall estate with additional funding from World Wildlife Fund-UK and the English Heritage Lottery Fund. Other partners involved in the project included Natural England and the Environment Agency (the Agency). The Agency’s role comprises management of the newly created habitats. Other public, voluntary and private parties which contributed were the University of East Anglia, Harwich Haven Authority, the Association of British Ports and Queen Mary University of London. 									b) ICZM tools									Detailed surveys took place in 2000. Water flow through the breaches, its scouring effects, sediment movements and how best to distribute the tidal flow on the landward side of the seawall were all modelled. As a result 5 breaches were proposed in the sea wall, 4 approx 10m. wide, 1 at 100m. Behind three of the breaches both main and feeder creeks 1-2m wide and 1m deep were created to distribute the inflowing water, whilst at both ends of the site counter walls were made to protect neighbouring land. A sill at 1.6m ODN was also left at the bottom of one breach in order to retain some water on its landward side at low tide.									The sea wall was breached in four out of 5 strategic locations in 2002. More than 80 hectares of the area that is flooded is expected to regenerate as a range of natural tidal habitats including SAC saltmarsh and SPA freshwater wetlands. Before the old sea wall could be breached several constructions were needed. Spur walls were built to protect the neighbouring properties. New creek systems were needed to promote the formation of new saltmarsh. The breaches in the sea wall had to be excavated to allow the tidal flooding of former arable land. A freshwater protection bund was constructed for an existing pond providing habitat for the great crested newt (a protected species) and the construction of a new freshwater lake to compensate for the loss of the ponds that were likely to become saline or brackish. Finally, three viewing hides for visitors were made. The sea is now back to where it was before the original seawalls were built. Accessibility is good with a good selection of public footpaths leading to the estuary and to the bird hides.									7. Cost and resources									Land costs came to £2.7 million; the managed realignment costs came to £645,000									8. Effectiveness (i.e. were the foreseen goals/objectives of the work reached?)									The work at Abbotts Hall has shown to be a cost effective, sustainable solution to coastal defence and also succeeded in producing major benefits towards national biodiversity targets. 49 ha of mudflat and saltmarsh and 35 ha of coastal grassland is being created.									9. Success and Fail factors									Stakeholder engagement: It was vital to identify all the stakeholders correctly and to communicate with them as early as possible. Much of the consultation took place through personal meetings. In short, consult widely and early; be sensitive to differing viewpoints &amp; be totally honest									Location: The choice of where to locate the realignment was vital for success.									Finance: There are two aspects: raising the funds for the initial work and then deriving an income from the project. Both are critical to the creation of a sustainable coastline. Significant investment is required to acquire the land and plan, design, and execute the realignment. The main economic benefits are the reduced costs of flood defence. Alternative means of generating income are e.g. sheep grazing, alternative crops such as samphire and asparagus, sport fishing, development of a marina. These options can boost local economies through increased recreational use and create jobs. Income was also received from the Countryside Stewardship Scheme 2001-11.									Planning: Application should be submitted as early as possible to ensure a quick(er) decision. 									Publicity: It is vital to manage the publicity of the project carefully and creatively by developing a communications strategy involving all the partners at the outset									Design: The design was viewed from as many perspectives as possible to ensure a balanced overall outcome. 									Construction: The site must be developed in such a way that it prevents serious disruption to the species occupying the area. The concerns of project stakeholders must be considered.									Visitor Information: Good interpretation boards and literature should be in place at an early stage,									Maintenance &amp; Monitoring: Realignment is a process that continues into the future, and thus presents responsibilities for all involved. The monitoring process provides an early warning of trends or changes; the maintenance process responds to this information.									10. Unforeseen outcomes									Effects on landscape, nature and culture values during the execution were negligible. The breach has benefitted fisheries by creating fish nurseries. It is also acting as a carbon sink and is a haven for wildlife with bird usage higher than previously recorded. Lapses in design continue to present problems long after it is too late to adjust them e.g. spoil left as earth banks alongside the creeks to provide escape routes for reptiles look unnatural.									11.

Overview of the case									A 50m breach was made in a dune defence wall to recreate a dynamic dune ecosystem behind it without compromising safety aspects against flooding from the sea.									5. Context and Objectives									a) Context									De Kerf (kerf = notch or nick) is located in the dunes of the province of North Holland. It is a breach in the outermost dune ridge that was created in 1997 covering an area of about 5ha. It was dug to allow natural contact again between the sea and the dune area behind the protective dune wall. It was the first time since the building of the sea defences around the Netherlands, following the flood of 1953, that the sea had been allowed through the defences.									The area is protected by the Nature Conservancy Act and is a Nature 2000 area (Special Area of Conservation or SAC). It has no special land use, apart from nature and has always been a relatively quiet part of the dune system in this area. A horse trail in the southern part of the valley was the only ‘infrastructure’ to access the area and the number of visitors was low. These ground water of the dunes was used as a drinking water supply by the water company of the Province of North-Holland. 									b) Objectives									The aim of the action was to realise a (experimental) tool for dynamic coastal management. The scheme essentially represented a large scale experiment to allow wind and sea to become the natural forces forming the landscape again, in order to restore a dynamic sea and wind driven dune system. Another aim was to increase the recreational value of the area.									6. Implementation of the ICZM Approach (i.e. management, tools, resources)									a) Management									The initiators of the project were the Dutch NGO Society for Dune Conservation, writers of the initial project plan, and the National Institute for Coastal and Marine Management which commissioned this plan. The managers of the area are the State Forestry Service. They kept up the subsequent administrative process that eventually resulted in the construction of ‘De Kerf’. The other important stakeholders were the Water Board and the Province of North-Holland.									b) ICZM tools									In 1997, a tidal inlet was created by excavating a valley up to 1.5 m above sea-level. The inlet has a minimum width of 50 m and a maximum width of 300 m. The topsoil of the valley was removed to allow the fresh water to reach the surface and to allow sand drift. About 130,000 m3 sand was removed. To facilitate the expected increasing number of visitors some recreational facilities were created e.g. a viewing point with information panels and a telescope; a cycle path; and two footpaths to the viewing point.									Natural processes are considered to be the best possible management for this area. Management is restricted to minimizing human impact on the area, e.g. by removing rubbish that floats in from the sea, and maintenance of recreational facilities. Several times each year the sea streams into the area resulting in a temporary brackish lake environment. This becomes increasing freshwater before it disappears into the sand. The surface of the ground is enriched by this process. Wind also plays an increasing role with calcium rich sand blown into the area from the beach creating new dune areas.									Before the actual construction of ‘De Kerf’ took place, a monitoring plan had been written. The proposed monitoring programme focused on both abiotic and biotic parameters although success criteria for the development were not precisely defined. Monitoring took place by professionals, students and volunteers. Since the creation of the breach, biodiversity has increased particularly inter-tidal, salt marsh, drifting sands and calcium rich dune grasslands species and those associated with moist dunes. These include a number of fungi that were new to the Netherlands or had previously become extinct. Ground beetles were another group that benefitted. The number of breeding birds is low although 2 pairs of ringed plover (Charadrius hiaticula) bred on the beach for the first time. Other species decreased in common with regional trends.									7. Cost and resources									The costs of ‘De Kerf’ were ca. €505,000, funded by the Ministry of Transport, Public Works and Water Management, the Ministry of Agriculture, Nature and Food Quality, and the Province of									North-Holland.									8. Effectiveness (i.e. were the foreseen goals/objectives of the work reached?)									The goals of the project to create a more dynamic ecosystem with gradients and different nature values were reached. This was done without increasing flood risk and compromising safety. Interestingly, if the area had been designated as an SAC area before creating the new tidal inlet, this project may have been prevented from proceeding. 									9. Success and Fail factors									The combined effort, enthusiasm and co-operation of the stakeholders, supported by well organized communication - to each other and the general public - played an important role in realizing ‘De Kerf’. Also strong effective project leaders within the organisations played a key role. Initially, the municipality of Bergen objected because of safety reasons (flooding) although they subsequently supported the scheme once they were reassured that the location would be safe.									10. Unforeseen outcomes									There was an unexpected increase in the number of visitors to the area especially from the beach side, including trespassers. On the boundary of the adjacent water board-owned dunes, a fence has been re-installed to prevent people entering a breeding area for birds. The costs for monitoring exceeded the estimated amount, due to higher costs for aerial photographs and more frequent monitoring.									11. Prepared by									A. H.

Experiences that can be exchanged									Strategic Environmental Assessment (SEA) when following a strategic approach can be built into the policy process in a constructive way to help, and facilitate, the integration of environmental and sustainability concerns in the formulation of objectives, setting the agenda, conceptual design and implementation. 									4. Overview of the case									SEA was used to closely assist the preparation of the Portuguese Strategy for Integrated Coastal Zone Management (PS-ICZM), achieving quite an integrated outcome. The SEA proved to act as a facilitator to enable the full integration of environmental and sustainability issues into the strategy development process, including identification of objectives, agenda setting, concept of the strategy and design of the implementation measures. SEA enabled the consideration of key strategic options to fine tune the strategy, and highlighted risks and opportunities associated with the strategy, proving, in the end, to have strongly influenced the ICZM strategy.									5. Context and Objectives									a) Context									The Portuguese coastline offers great landscape quality, bio-geographical and geo-morphological variation in its 1,187 km of length from north to south, and along the Algarve coast from west to east. Coastal characteristics range from low sandy coasts, with or without natural barriers, to high and rocky cliffs, interspaced by river mouths, estuarine and coastal lagoons, mostly exposed to the Atlantic influence. Human occupation affects the coast line in two main forms: along river basins, increasing the sedimentation rate at the mouth of rivers, and by direct occupation in large sections of the coast. In fact, 75% of the Portuguese population live in the coastal areas, which are also responsible for 85% of internal gross product through urban and industrial activities, intensive tourism, rural activities and fisheries. Portugal has one of the largest economic exclusive zones in all Europe, with over 1,700,000 km2, which represents 18 times its land area. This area represents an enormous potential of the Portuguese maritime resources. Over 30% of the coast line is legally protected as a natural area within the National Protected Areas network, while 50% of the area is statutorily integrated in Natura 2000. The coast is quite vulnerable to natural risks such as coastal erosion, tsunamis, sedimentation deficit in the continental platform, coastal areas flooding, loss of biodiversity, increase in salinisation of estuarine and ground-waters.									In Portugal, public participation was conducted in 2006 on a preliminary document proposing the Basis for the National ICZM Strategy which was later published in 2007 by the Ministry of Environment, Spatial Planning and Regional Development. In this document, the fundamental principles and objectives for ICZM in Portugal are laid out which have then been adopted by the National Strategy for ICZM, reaffirming the national purposes and reinforcing an integrated vision for ICZM, including the policy drivers established by the Maritime Strategy European Framework and the challenge of ensuring a clear articulation between the planning and management of the maritime space and the conservation of the sea. Strategic Environmental Assessment (SEA) was used to assist the preparation of the Portuguese Strategy for Integrated Coastal Zone Management (PS-ICZM). SEA is not legally mandatory for application at policy level in Portugal. However the National Water Institute (INAG), the Portuguese authority mandated by the Portuguese Government to develop this PS-ICZM, understanding the merits and the added-value of SEA for strategic decision-making, decided to use SEA on this occasion. The SEA was developed together with the strategy.									b) Objectives									The objective of the SEA was to contribute to the integration of environmental and sustainability issues in the development of the PS-ICZM, and to identify, and compare, policy options in terms of risks and opportunities for the environment and sustainability. The leading intention was to create conditions for the sustainable management of human activities in coastal areas to safeguard the integrity of ecological systems, the recognition of ecosystem services, the sustainable use and management of coastal resources, the avoidance and minimisation of natural and technological risks and the adoption of governance approaches for sustainable and integrated coastal management.									6. Implementation of the ICZM Approach (i.e. management, tools, resources)									a) Management									The National Water Institute (INAG) is the Portuguese authority mandated by the Portuguese Government to develop the PS-ICZM. 									b) SEA of the ICZM tools									A strategic-based methodology for SEA was adopted. This methodology basically establishes an iterative process with the strategy formation and formulation process, ensures a strong focus for the SEA right at the beginning, helps to identify and to discuss and compare strategic options, conducts an assessment of risks and opportunities of the strategy for the environment and sustainability and, based on outcomes, issues guidelines to assist implementation and ensure continued follow-up. The SEA started off by identifying the object of assessment, which was expressed as the main concept, drivers and strategic purposes of the PS-ICZM, and the scope of the assessment through the identification of a small number of strategic themes which were recognised as being crucial for integrated and sustainable coastal management in a strategic context. Named as Critical Decision Factors (CDF), such crucial themes were used to structure the SEA and ensure a strong focus in the assessment. The CDF are established in relation to the context of the coastal management policy and establish a direct link to possible sustainable follow-up; in other words, if things go wrong with respect to those themes, the sustainability of the coastal management policy will be at risk. But the CDF will express opportunities where things go well. This means therefore that these themes are crucial not only for a policy formation phase, but also for policy implementation phase and monitoring processes. 									The CDF were identified through the cross-relationship of three main components: key strategic issues, or drivers, of the PS-ICZM; environmental and sustainability issues; and a strategic reference framework (SRF) that collects and interprets all major macro-policies for coastal management in Portugal and at the European and international level, including the Maritime Strategy, the Water Framework Directive, the White Paper on Climate Change, the Natura 2000, the Maritime European Policy, the European Union Strategy for Sustainable Development as well as national policies. The background of the PS-ICZM was considered with respect to the initial studies and public discussions undertaken in the previous three years. Four CDFs were adopted: Ecological systems and coastal landscapes, Coastal resources and uses, Natural and technological risks, and Management and governance, representing four strategic factors for the success of the PS-ICZM. Options for the PS-ICZM were then assessed in two rounds of assessment, using these CDF and respective criteria. Three sets of strategic options were considered – thematic, institutional and model of governance - and for each set, three alternative options were assessed. The options were compared, in a first round of assessment, in terms of their risks and opportunities, the results of which provided policy indications which were subsequently used in the identification of priorities and strategic objectives, measures and actions to be followed. The strategic objectives of the PS-ICZM were then subsequently assessed in a second round of assessment as to their opportunities and risks considering the measures and actions envisaged to implement the objectives. The results of the second assessment round were then used to refine the PS-ICZM. Guidelines for planning, management and monitoring were then proposed by the SEA and adopted by the PS-ICZM.									7. Cost and resources									The resources needed for the SEA were provided by the INAG. It took roughly three months to develop the PS-ICZM and respective SEA, and two additional months with public and institutional discussions following the preparation of the two instruments. 									8. Effectiveness (i.e. were the foreseen goals/objectives of the work reached?)									The SEA of the PS-ICZM is an example of good governance at policy level, revealing how SEA can be used as an enabler and facilitator of integrated and sustainable policy decisions, and how SEA and policy-making processes can be jointly carried out with mutual benefits regarding shared information and team collaboration, jointly motivated by the similar purpose of enhancing a strategic, sustainability integrated policy instrument.									9. Success and Fail factors									A simultaneous and strong iterative process, and team collaboration enabled by the leadership of INAG make good ingredients for the success of this case. Scarce public engagement, limited time and resources contributed to limit greater success in this case.									10. Unforeseen outcomes									The PS-ICZM is a reference instrument for the development of the Maritime Spatial Plan at a very macro-level, and also for regional and municipal spatial plans in the coastal areas, however with a relatively smaller impact in relation to changes in coastal land occupation.									11.

To answer these questions novel climate parameters on polar ice cores are needed that go beyond previous studies in terms of temporal resolution, spatial coverage as well as quantitative representativeness. This proposal intends to develop such methods based on latest advances in analytical techniques and to apply them to polar ice cores. The common theme of the new approaches within MATRICs is the reconstruction of new, quantitative temperature information from different regions of the Earth all on the same core avoiding crucial crossdating issues. This comprises (i) continuous quantitative reconstructions of local temperature changes on polar ice sheets in seasonal resolution using new approaches, (ii) estimates of climate changes in continental, not permanently ice covered regions based on concurrent changes in the methane cycle and (iii) a new physical ice core gas thermometer for mean global ocean temperature.

Macrophytes (aquatic plants large enough to see with the naked eye) include seaweed, algae and kelp. They are an important component of these habitats, as they support biodiversity (including fish), stabilise bottom sediments and maintain coastal water quality and clarity. Some algae are also extensively used in the chemical, pharmaceutical and food industry. But they are highly susceptible to environment variations, impacting on local food webs and ecosystems. 
In the Arctic, where climate change is the most readily visible, macrophytes are important indicators of habitat health and glacier melting. 
The project will consist in adapting to multibeam echosounders the innovative techniques (including multidimensional wavelet decomposition of acoustic echoes and fuzzy-logic clustering) developed by the applicant for single-beam echosounders. This will allow imaging of larger portions of seabed, at faster survey speeds. This approach will be validated using large datasets acquired by the host institution for Arctic macrophytes in Kongsfjord (Svalbard) and temperate macrophytes in British Columbia, concurrent with still images and biological sampling by divers. The Arctic dataset consists in co-registered single-beam and multibeam measurements.  Comparison of overlapping beams will provide a meaningful, quantitative basis for users of either (or both) systems. These results will be directly useable in other regions and a sea trial is envisaged in a suitable temperate and/or Arctic site. By translating validated processing schemes to new instruments, this will create a unified approach to the acoustic imaging of macrophytes, using standardised processing to reliably estimate spatial distribution and biomass of different macrophytes using any kind of echosounder Impact assessment and indicatorRisk assessment and uncertainties International', 'Impact assessment and indicatorRisk assessment and uncertainties', 'International', NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, 'MARINE;', 'VULNERABILITY;', NULL);

Control measures of managerial and technological nature will be developed in the supply chain of crop production, post-harvest processing and logistics to minimize food safety risks. The assessment of the performance of horticultural safety management systems by a novel diagnostic instrument at EU level exemplified by several countries in Europe and tailored on a global level including major EU trade partners from various climate zones will lead to recommendations on European and global level on quality assurance and the setting of science-based performance objectives. 
VEG-i-TRADE will pro-actively invest in problem solving technologies for safe produce investigating aspects of water quality and water treatment, horticultural production practices, disinfection treatment and packaging technologies. These control measures will be exploited in collaboration with SMEs and industrial partners. Baseline studies on the hazards, intervention technologies and best practices in the fresh produce chain will provide input for both microbial and chemical risk assessment to elaborate support to risk-based sampling plans, evaluate the risks of newly identified threats as affected by the global trade system and anticipated climate change.  The project output will craft a discussion forum for stakeholders in the global food chain reflecting on issues of acceptable risk, sustainability of fresh produce production and long term strategy of international food trade, while making no compromise in food safety for European consumers and in respectation of food sovereignty. Risk communication to increase awareness of trade partners production systems and the uneven consumer behaviour will provide key conditions for prioritisation of risk management strategies.

•to address and reduce deficiencies in projections of future climate change;
•to quantify our confidence and the uncertainties in predictions of future climate and its impacts, using an array of climate models and impact models and expert judgment on their performance;
•to interpret these results in relation to European policies for adapting to or mitigating climate change.
PRUDENCE is part of a co-operative cluster of projects exploring future changes in extreme events in response to global warming. The other members of the cluster are MICE (Modelling the Impact of Climate Extremes) and STARDEX (Statistical and Regional Dynamic downscaling of Extremes for European regions). This research is highly relevant to current climate related problems in Europe. PRUDENCE will provide a series of high-resolution climate change scenarios for 2071-2100 for Europe, characterising the variability and level of confidence in these scenarios as a function of uncertainties in model formulation, natural/internal climate variability, and alternative scenarios of future atmospheric composition. The project will provide a quantitative assessment of the risks arising from changes in regional weather and climate in different parts of Europe, by estimating future changes in extreme events such as flooding and windstorms and by providing a robust estimation of the likelihood and magnitude of such changes. The project will also examine the uncertainties in potential impacts induced by the range of climate scenarios developed from the climate modelling results. This will provide useful information for climate modellers on the levels of accuracy in climate scenarios required by impact analysts. Furthermore, a better appreciation of the uncertainty range in calculations of future impacts from climate change may offer new insights into the scope for adaptation and mitigation responses to climate change. In order to facilitate this exchange of new information, the PRUDENCE work plan places emphasis on the wide dissemination of results and preparation of a non-technical project summary aimed at policy makers and other interested parties.

Context and Objectives									a) Context									The area is located in the southern region of the Tagus river mouth and to the north of Setúbal Peninsula between Cova do Vapor to the south of Costa da Caparica village, in the municipality of Almada. Millions of people use the Costa da Caparica beach during summer and the urban seafront re-development is included in a major national programme for urban areas. This coastal zone is a plain coast with an arc shape that represents the most important fossil cliff in Portugal. The cliff is protected from the sea by a considerable extension of sand. The Portuguese coast has, in general, a high population in relation to the rest of the territory and  Almada municipality is no exception, exacerbated by its proximity to the capital city, Lisbon with its 3 million inhabitants. Coastal erosion is a very serious problem and probably will increase as a response to the continuous weakening of the river sediment sources, the dredging works, the mean sea-level rise, the waterfront human settlement, the changing of the morpho-dynamics pattern and other causes. These erosion events, together with insufficient coastal management plans increase the vulnerability risk and the need for protection against coastline retreat, overtopping, flooding and infrastructure destruction. 									There are records of erosion in Costa do Vapor dating from 1947, reaching Costa da Caparica village in 1958. The first defence work, a groyne, was constructed in 1959 and a second added in 1962 followed by a third and a sea-wall a year later. These works were intended to constitute a hard nucleus to hold the coastline. In 1959, a dyke was also built on the south side (between Cova do Vapor and Costa da Caparica) with the aim of avoiding sea flooding during storms which over-washed the existent dunes. Nonetheless, in 1964, the central area of Costa da Caparica was seriously flooded. The dyke was re-inforced and a further small groyne was constructed. Between 1968 - 1971 the three groynes of Cova do Vapor were enlarged. Between 1972 -  2000, the coastline was more or less stable. However, the persistent winter of 2000/2001 demonstrated that this area is very unstable and vulnerable. In Costa da Caparica, after this winter, a great part of the groyne sea defences were damaged, there was no sand on the beaches and the beaches stayed partially under water at high tide.  									b) Objectives									The main objective was to determine the best policy option for this stretch of coastline. Urban pressure and erosion lead to particular difficulties concerning the management of the area and few studies have been done on these types of impacts in Portugal. 									6. Implementation of the ICZM Approach (i.e. management, tools, resources)									a) Management									The Instituto de Hidráulica e Recursos Hídricos (IHRH) was responsible for this work. 									b) ICZM tools									The actual urban waterfront is defended by coastal structures that need maintenance and constant re-formulation with respect to the length of the groynes and the seawall crest. In such highly exposed areas, &quot;soft&quot; coastal defences are not effective. It is, therefore, not only necessary to adopt a “preventive” policy but also a “curative” one because of the severity of the present problems. The interventions in the defence works with artificial sand  nourishment consist basically of:-																																Re-shaping of the existent groynes:													Increasing the length of those that will have a “structural” role.													Reducing the length of the ones that could be, in the medium-term, eliminated.													These operations should be preferentially realized downdrift of the structures in the north or updrift of those in the south, in order to improve the capacity of sand retention.													Reshaping the existent seawall.													Recognising the vital importance of the seawall in terms of defence and the existence of alternatives such as a retreat of built waterfront (streets and buildings).													Pathways and seaside road renovation.													Proceeding with artificial sand nourishment using sand originating off-shore.													Feeding the beaches updrift (south) of the groynes field of Costa da Caparica, between the groynes of Costa da Caparica and updrift (south) of S. João''s beach.													These deposit places should always be located updrift (south) of the areas to be nourished so that they will be modelled by the action of the sea and so moved to re-configure the beach. The dunes of S. João''s beach will also benefit from this operation.																															The medium-term (five-year) solution, in conjunction with artificial sand nourishment, will eliminate some intermediate groynes and will increase the length of those that will become the defence structure groynes. However, the destruction of some groynes will only be done if monitoring surveys demonstrate their inefficiency. The need to increase the length of the defence structure groynes, as well as their configuration, will be better assessed after monitoring. In addition, the need for constructing a breakwater should also be assessed after monitoring data within the next few years.									7. Cost and resources									No costs are available.									8. Effectiveness (i.e. were the foreseen goals/objectives of the work reached?)									The research into new coastal defence technical solutions and/or the improvement of the current ones should be promoted. However, it is not expected that more environmental and cost effective solutions will appear in the next years. This coast line is evolving, and if nothing is done or planned carefully, it is possible that in the future, important repercussions will occur. The urban area must be restricted to where over-wash and flooding risk are absent. It is not coherent to expand the construction of buildings or beach supports to areas where the risk of destruction is very high after building sea defences to protect these infrastructures. In 2000/2001 severe and persistent sea actions occurred, where it was shown that the area is vulnerable and that the destruction of the sea defences is a possibility. It is essential to always remember that the area is very unstable, and there is a great probability of change with extreme physical dynamics. The capacity to forecast the medium and long-term beach evolution continues to be very limited due to scientific constraints. Apart from this limitation, the inadequacy of field data (namely topo-hydrographic studies) is a major obstacle for the quantification, understanding and forecasting of the phenomena. It is important to implement a monitoring plan capable of recording data, and to improve the understanding and comprehension of the dynamic processes in the area. The quantity of sand needed for artificial sand nourishment is very large (up to two million cubic meters), therefore, using just locally available amounts is out of the question (e.g. using ripping techniques as used in emergency interventions). The sand to be used will be from off-shore or sediments dredged for harbour maintenance, provided that it has the right quality for this purpose. It is important that the artificially introduced sand is similar to what is on the beach, in terms of size, colour and quality.									9. Success and Fail factors									This area is more or less in equilibrium after the groyne field construction in Costa da Caparica (1972) and three groyne expansions in Cova do Vapor (1968/1971). It is important to note the great urban expansion that occurred between 1972 and 1996, despite the fact that the coastal stretch was still vulnerable to storms, even with the coastal defence works. This expansion of the waterfront urban area could reach the adjacent area, provoking worsening and increasing effects of sea actions and risks. In the persistent winter of 2000/2001, the destruction of the beach-users’ facilities improperly located above the primary dune in S. João beach occurred. This beach lost a great amount of sand and the dunes suffered an intense erosive process. The beach-user facilities must and will be relocated, but the beach and the dunes, according to the historical record and the recent dynamics, are unlikely to recover their profiles through only natural actions.									10. Unforeseen outcomes									The sea defences built in 1972 have had an important role in Costa da Caparica defence. The seawall was able to stop Costa da Caparica from flooding, but the now degraded groyne field was not able to recover the beach configuration. It is not rational to expand the construction of buildings or beach supports to areas where there is a high risk of destruction, after building sea defences to protect these infrastructures.									11.

In this case, the last policy document, dating from 2000, was evaluated for its effectiveness after seven years of implementation.									4. Overview of the case									A desk top study, together with a meeting and interviews with stakeholders, provided the basis for assessing whether the Third Coastal Policy document dating from 2000 was still relevant in 2007 and to what extent the objectives set out had been actually achieved.									5. Context and Objectives									a) Context									The Third Coastal Policy document, brought out by the Ministry of Transport, Public Works and Water Management in 2000, gives a long-term perspective of dynamic coastal management in the Netherlands. It followed similar documents written in 1990 and 1995 but expanded policy options to include a broader range of coastal functionality e.g. spatial planning, nature and environment, economic issues and, of course, safety. As a policy paper, it has no legal basis for implementing authorities although any deviation from it during management of the coast needs to be justified.									In 2007, questions were being asked as to how relevant the document was and whether it was still applicable for the current coastal problems? Would the same policy choices be made in 2007 as were made in 2000? Therefore, it was determined to evaluation the effectiveness of the coastal policy being implemented as a result of the policy described in the document. This evaluation was also to have  learning and agenda-setting goals. The main questions for the evaluation were:																																To what extent have the goals described been achieved? (goal achievement).													To what extent is the achievement of these goals the result of the policy described? (policy ffectiveness).													To what extent was the implementation of the coastal policy and the way the stakeholders were involved in it organised efficiently? (policy efficiency).													What lessons, based on the pursued policy, could be learned?													What problems have to be solved to secure a sustainable coastal policy in the future?																															In order to perform the evaluation, these questions were operationalised into more specific ones.									b) Objectives									The goal of the evaluation was to give an insight into how far the goals of the Third Coastal Policy have been reached and to the extent that these targets were reached as a result of implementing the policy contained in the document. Therefore, the focus of the evaluation lay in the effectiveness of the described policy.									6. Implementation of the ICZM Approach (i.e. management, tools, resources)									a) Management									The Ministry of Transport, Public Works and Water Management led the evaluation. Under the supervision of the National Institute for Coastal and Marine Management and an inter-departmental committee, two consultancy bureaus Twynstra Gudde and Alkyon carried out this evaluation.									b) ICZM tools									The evaluation was conducted by desktop research augmented by interviews with a range of stakeholders and one meeting of stakeholders. To conduct the work, a ‘Goal Instrument Network’ was formulated for every main goal in order to schematically point out which sub-goals were being pursued in order to achieve the main goals of the Third Coastal Policy Document. These were then linked to the efforts needed to attain them as mentioned in the policy document. In this way, it was possible to determine to what extent the (sub)goals had been achieved and whether this was the result of the policy described in the Third Coastal Policy Document. The efficiency in which the policy was carried out was also examined.									On the basis of this evaluation, it was concluded that:																																The first main goal described in the Third Coastal Policy Document (sustainable protection of the low Netherlands (safety against flooding) has been achieved in the period to be studied. This achievement was the result of the pursued policy and the efforts described in the Third Coastal Policy Document have actually been executed.													The second main goal (the use of space in the coastal area in harmony with sustainable protection of the low Netherlands) has been partially achieved and is still ‘under construction’. One of the reasons for this is the fact that policy with regard to spatial planning had still not been fully developed and officially endorsed. The building policy for the coastal zone remains controversial and although the national spatial strategy (‘Nota Ruimte’) now contains a paragraph about the coast, the government is still working on new environmental policy. Therefore, because there is no unambiguous national policy at this moment, the policy as described in The Third Coastal Policy Document has not been carried out everywhere. This is because, for many actors, it is still not clear what they are allowed and not allowed to do with regard to the use of space in the coastal area.																															However, these two goals were considered to be formulated too implicitly. Furthermore, the judicial status of the Third Coastal Policy Document as well as of the policy instruments is weak. There is an awareness that spatial planning is only a subject of discussion when safety has been secured. This implies, in terms of integrated policy, that there is a hierarchy with safety foremost and only then spatial planning, nature  and economy. Nonetheless, this is not explicitly formulated. 									7. Cost and resources									The evaluation took place over a period of six months and cost ca. €100,000. It can be noted that the Netherlands, for the period evaluated (2000-07), had a national annual budget of ca. €45 million per year for coastal management measures.									8. Effectiveness (i.e. were the foreseen goals/objectives of the work reached?)									With regard to the first main goal of the Third Coastal Policy Document, it can be concluded that it has been carried out in an effective and efficient way. The other main goal was carried out in a less effective and efficient way. This has to do with the fact that other (sub)goals are not formulated sufficiently concretely for realisation. Also, the complexity of governmental organisation and processes and the relatively weak instruments make the policy less efficient. Regarding policy implementation, efficiency improvements can be made by bringing together governance and managerial matters for each inter-connected water system. The framework for decision-making about sand nourishment can be improved e.g. by combining with maintenance dredging or innovative tendering. Financing the implementation of the policies is still problematic. Local authorities expect financing from central government for specific policy matters whereas central government expects the financing to be taken from the spatial planning budgets of the authorities. These financial issues sometimes lead to opportunities of measures or new insights being lost.									The evaluation revealed visions that are, on the one hand, focused on small scale improvement and reinforcement and, on the other hand point, to the direction of large scale seaward developments. An overall vision and statement about the level of the interventions that should take place in the future is necessary i.e. will local interventions suffice or is intervention on a larger and higher scale required e.g. with artificial reefs, islands in front of the coast or coastal expansion? In this perspective, the Third Coastal Policy Document is rather conservative (holding the coastline of 1990). It focuses on preventing structural erosion and on landward expansion of the coastline and limits ‘seaward expansion’ and related ambitions. Opinions amongst stakeholders varied on the question whether the document would be more effective were it to be given a higher status than a policy document i.e. be grounded in law.									9. Success and Fail factors									The evaluation underlines the importance of the expertise of stakeholders. The responsibility for a fully integrated management of the coast lies within several different ministries viz. The Ministries of Transport, Public Works &amp; Water Management; Traffic, Spatial Planning &amp; Environment: Economic Affairs; and Agriculture, Nature &amp; Food. Thus, there is no overall responsibility for (sustainable) development and no mechanism to couple it to a financial base.									10. Unforeseen outcomes									The evaluation pointed out several dilemmas and problems that still need to be solved e.g. whether building in the coastal zone should be allowed –  a number of regional authorities allow building for economic reasons although central government does not always approve; the private sector feels that there are insufficient incentives to invest in the coast. 									11.

- Climate change and water management and modelling; Water scarcity and management is a cross-cutting issue in the world. This is especially true in the Mediterranean region where water resources are limited and water issues are the most urgent. Modelling the water, solute and erosion dynamics will be done by means of the J2000 physically based system which will be supported by GIS-analysis and remote sensing;

- Climate change and the ecosystem productivity; The main steps are, a) Classification, quantification and analysis of land-use, b) Collection of inputs (climate, soil and biotic data) for simulation models, c) Quantification of C-N budgets and simulation of temperature rise scenarios. These topics are interdisciplinary in nature and involve processes that are relevant to biophysical ecology, biogeography, and climate. To study these topics, the research relies heavily on remote sensing, biophysical models of land-atmosphere energy exchange, GIS and statistical methods.

Unfortunately, as a result of the measures outlined above, the groundwater level is considerably lowered during dry spells, enabling oxygen to penetrate the soil. When exposed to oxygen, sulphides oxidize and produce sulphuric acid and make the soil extremely acid (pH 2,5-4), which in turn mobilizes enormous quantities of metals (including Al, Cd, Co, Ni and Zn) stored in the soil. Together with acidity, these metals are flushed from the soils into drains and recipient estuaries during wet spells.  Metal discharges from AS-soils are estimated to significantly exceed the corresponding industrial discharges from all Finnish industry. This is also the case for cadmium, one of the priority substance metals regulated by the EU Environmental Quality Standard (EG-EQS) Directive (2008/105/EC). Moreover, cadmium concentrations also exceed the environmental quality standards in many waterbodies affected by AS-soils.  The extensive pool of toxic metals in these soils with high risk of mobilisation has not been adequately understood until very recently. The chemical composition and drainage water quality of AS-soils resembles those of sulphur rich metal ores, which cause similar acidity problems in Europe and worldwide.

Experiences that can be exchanged									Habitat creation by foreshore recharge using dredged materials. Recharging is the placement of sediment such as sands, gravels and muds in front of existing sea defences. It can be used on its own or with other coastal flood management techniques. It is suitable at a variety of sites, on both sheltered and exposed coasts. It is appropriate where loss of foreshore is increasing risk of defence failure and where it is not economically justifiable to construct hard engineering defences at a higher cost.  It is also beneficial as a technique to improve the quality of degraded habitats.									4. Overview of the case									Dredged harbour materials were used to recharge the foreshore of a defended island to give added flood protection, create new habitat and improve and reduce the cost of flood maintenance. 									5. Context and Objectives									a) Context									Horsey Island, ca. 340 hectares, is located within the inlet of Hamford Water as part of the Walton backwater an embayed estuary in north Essex in the east of England. The island is strategically important to provide protection against wave action to the Backwaters, thereby reducing erosion. However, between 1925 and 1983 some 75 ha. of salt marsh and 218 ha. of foreshore have been lost from the inlets of Hamford Water. Horsey Island is nationally and internationally important, being designated as a national nature Reserve (NNR), Special protection (SPA) and a Ramsar Site, with wet (freshwater) grasslands and areas of salt marsh and muddy inter-tidal flats providing important breeding and feeding grounds for many species of birds. Farming is still practiced. Without protection, the foreshore will continue to be eroded and the wall protecting the north face of the island would be breached. As  the NNR/SPA site is 2 metres below mean sea level, it would be flooded.									The scheme forms part of an overall strategy for sustainable flood defences set out by the Environment Agency to the Essex Local Flood Defence Committee in April 2000. The project area is approx. 1.5 hectares and includes foreshore recharge onto inter-tidal mudflats and degraded salt marsh. The area encompasses several different types of habitat with commercial fishing (cultivation of native oysters and small scale herring, sprat and sole). The waters are also used by recreational sailors.									b) Objectives									The aim of this project was to create an improved coastal defence which would be more economical and more sustainable. It was also the intention to increase the overall extent and quality of salt marsh habitat.									6. Implementation of the ICZM Approach (i.e. management, tools, resources)									a) Management									The Environmental Agency were responsible for the recharging. Other partners involved were the University of East Anglia, Essex Wildlife Trust,  Natural England, Harwich Haven Authority, Assoc. of British Ports MER &amp; Queen Mary University of London.									b) ICZM tools									A cost-benefit analysis identified that the preferred option, based on financial considerations was to recharge the designated area using dredged material from the Harwich Haven Estuary. 									The work was conducted in phases between 2000 and 2007. Foreshore recharging was initially done onto inter-tidal mudflats using 50,000m3 of coarser, dredged materials from the Felixstowe port development. This raised the level of the foreshore such that around 40% of the area would remain as inter-tidal mudflat while the remaining 60%, adjacent to the sea wall, would be colonised with salt marsh vegetation. This gave extra protection to the adjacent seawall and the neighbouring salt marsh from extreme wave action. In the final phase six hectares of degraded salt marsh were recharged using 150,000m3 material from annual maintenance dredgings from Harwich haven authority.  These sediments are usually dredged and dumped at sea depriving the coast of a valuable sediment resource given the current net loss of marshes locally.  The materials were fine muds pumped under pressure and placed at the highest tide level on degraded marsh. The innovative use of flexible piping reduced damage to existing marsh areas and allowed greater flexibility for recharging less accessible areas. . Careful monitoring pre- and post the placement of material was carried out due to the presence of local shellfisheries. Brush wood and geo-textile fences were erected across creeks to prevent migration of the deposited material away from the site into the surrounding estuary. Through careful management of the silts no wider impacts were demonstrated.  Deposition of the dredged material took place at high tide twice a day, to  maximise water depths to accommodate the dredger and took around 12 days to complete. The timing of the works was carried out to minimise bird disturbance. The existing salt marsh has been raised through the recharge process to help it cope with increasing sea level rise and the quality of the marsh has also greatly improved returning it to favourable condition status..									7. Cost and resources									Harwich Haven Authority contributed £169,500 in dredged materials and the Environment Agency paid for works and materials at the Sum of £77,110 which included EA retaining ownership of 200m of flexible, 410mm hose and connectors.									8. Effectiveness (i.e. were the foreseen goals/objectives of the work reached?)									This work has improved the level of flood defence in an economically viable and environmentally sustainable manner. After only nine months, considerable salt marsh growth (Salicornia sp.) had occurred over parts of the recharged area. The abundance of the ragworm Nereis, supports a thriving sea bass fishery and bird populations. A new marsh habitat also formed behind the recharged material. Now, the erosion of the foreshore has been arrested and the wetland is being restored. Not only has new habitat been created but the flood defence maintenance costs have been reduced. The new beaches, mudflats and salt marsh created from this approach act as natural flood defences reducing tidal currents and breaking up wave activity from the North Sea. The sediments used in the recharge would otherwise have been taken out to sea and dumped. This technique is therefore important in helping to restore natural estuary sediment balance given the increased erosion of inter-tidal areas as a result of climate change and sea level rise. The Horsey Island recharge scheme is considered to be one of the most successful projects of its type carried out in the UK in terms of providing the coastal defence function for which is was designed.									9. Success and Fail factors									It was felt that the chief landowner was particularly receptive to new ideas. The fact that there is no public access was also beneficial. Cooperation with the local stakeholders – the fishers and recreational sailors – was also deemed to be important.  The port were a critical partner in providing sediment and dredger.  The cost of the sediments and dredger were derived from the additional cost of sailing into Hamford twice a day for 2 days in a shallow berth dredger compared to the routine dredger trips to the offshore dumping ground in a larger dredger.									10. Unforeseen outcomes									So far no unforeseen outcomes have been observed. The site is being regularly monitored. Pre- and post-monitoring surveys have shown changes to the fauna as a result of using coarser materials but these are as predicted. There has been a switch in dominance from species associated with muds to those associated with coarser material. Nereis virens has increased significantly in abundance.

The International Union for Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources (IUCN) FP 7 European In recent years large parts of Europe suffered from extreme drought, a phenomenon that likely will become more frequent and more severe, as predicted by the climate models. This will lead to significant socio-economic and environmental impacts and associated damages. There is therefore an urgent need to develop a roadmap toward a European Drought Policy, in accordance with the EU-Water Framework Directive (WFD) and related EU Legislation and Actions. The aim is to mitigate and to adapt to droughts, and hence reduce the risks they pose in Europe . 

 XEROCHORE SA compiles a roadmap that comprises of: 
1) a state-of-the-art review and identification of the research gaps in the natural system, in impact assessment, in policy-making and in integrated water resources management, and 
2) an assessment of the possible impacts of droughts and guidance on appropriate responses for stakeholders. 

An extended network of experts gathers inputs for the roadmap through focussed workshops, round table discussions, which integrate the various aspects, and a concluding conference. A Core Group guides and facilitates the discussion and synthesis process, and eventually write the integrated roadmap. The project network consists of over 80 organizations including research institutes, universities, ministries, water management organizations, stakeholders, consultants, international organizations and programmes Knowledge exchange

Experiences that can be exchanged									Large scale technical measures of flood defence can have a profound effect on natural and socio-economic values. With carefully considered management measures, such effects can be largely reversed.									4. Overview of the case									In the southwest Netherlands, a tidal, delta saltwater arm was cut off by human intervention from the sea in 1961 resulting in a brackish water, non-tidal lake. Following decades of ecological and water quality deterioration, efforts have begun, with success, to restore the salt water character of the water body by partially opening one of the dams and altering the water level of the lake in winter to create a limited ebb and flood tide.									5. Context and Objectives									a) Context									The Veerse Meer (or Lake) exists because of the flood defence measures that were taken following the 1953 flooding of the country. The coastline of southwest Netherlands was strengthened and the delta island of North Beveland was “joined” to the southern deltaic arm of Walcheren and South Beverland by dams, cutting off the sea and creating the lake in 1961. It became brackish with no tidal flows and the water level was artificially maintained. In summer, the water level was held 70cm higher than in winter to aid farmers (water drainage). Socio-economic changes occurred with fishing replaced by recreation. The lack of salt and the unnatural water levels effected the water quality adversely and changed the ecosystems: the mudflats and salt marshes dried out, 70 bottom-dwelling species were reduced to 20, fish species were reduced from 35 to 18 whilst bird species increased from 17 to 69. The area is now most known for its recreation although problems remain. The deeper parts of the lake have little or no oxygen in the summer causing death of plants and animals. In the shallow regions in summer, sea lettuce grows in abundance, rots and smells whilst other species regularly cause algal blooms. 									The deterioration of the water quality led to a negative spiral with respect to tourism and the economy of the area. In 1989, a report had shown that partially opening one of the dams would be likely to lead to an improvement in the ecology of the lake. This was eventually realised in 2004 when one of the dams was partially opened by a lock to allow brackish water to enter the lake. This had a positive effect on both water quality and nature development. Now, up to 40m3/s water is exchanged on each ebb and flood tide producing a limited tidal difference of 12cm. Nonetheless, the water exchange is still not optimal and vegetation is still poor in the drier areas of the banks and there is no stable bottom life. In winter, recreation is limited. In 2000, in order to still further improve the situation of the Lake, the Province of Zeeland, the regional government, undertook an integrated planning and vision venture (Rondom het Veerse Meer/Around the Veerse Lake). This took into account the whole functional area around the lake involving parts of four local administrations and including recreation and tourism, traffic and transport, water management, agriculture, nature and landscape, environment and spatial planning. 									b) Objectives									To improve the water quality of the lake and give a socio-economic impulse into the area.									6. Implementation of the ICZM Approach (i.e. management, tools, resources)									a) Management									The responsibility for the integrated venture is the Province of Zeeland. The State Forestry Authority and the Zeeland Water Board are responsible for managing the islands and nature and recreation areas along the coastline. The project has a Steering Committee of national, regional and local government representatives as well as other relevant stakeholders developing vision, partner agreements and monitoring the progress of the work.									b) ICZM tools									Further planning started in 2005 to determine the necessary water levels that were required to improve both the ecological and recreational values. An Environmental Impact Assessment was conducted – mandatory by law if the water level is to change by more than 16 cm. Four alternatives were looked at, all of them maintaining a summer level of –0.1m mean sea level (MSL) but with winter levels of:- (a) –0.6m or no change option; (b) –0.1m, or the nature and recreation option; (c) 0.1m but with an emergency level of –0.5m or the water management option; and (d) –0.3m but with an emergency level of –0.3m or the agricultural option. A cost and benefit analysis was conducted and all three alternatives requiring change showed a €3.3-3.9 m surplus over a 30 year period. The Most Environmentally Friendly alternative was considered to be alternative (c). The decision finally fell for alternative (d) in 2007. The summer level will be allowed to vary between zero and –0.1m MSL and the winter levels between –0.2m and –0.4m MSL. Implementation of the measures need to be completed by 2015 with no more than 0.1m change per year to allow for the vegetation to acclimatise. An evaluation is to follow in 2015. The planning for the future measures is as follows:-																																At the end of October 2009, the measures to ensure the winter water level is 40cm under mean sea level will take place;													Spring 2010, the measures to ensure the summer water level is 5cm under mean sea level will take place;													At the end of October 2010, the measures to ensure the new winter water level is 30cm under mean sea level will take place. This will be the last measure taken.																															The expectation is that, in future, only 200 ha. will dry out benefitting both shallow dwelling animals and plants. The additional depth will benefit water recreation. The Province is continuously monitoring the water levels and researching the effects of the changed water levels on the biotic life. Ground water levels are expected to remain as they have been.									Simultaneously, the Province began the integrated venture in close discussion with the responsible government Ministry. This was a framework plan that was to have a fifteen year implementation period. Not everything was concretely written into the plan to allow for flexibility in the future (adaptive management). It does present a total plan of the problems that need to be solved with the direction of the solutions outlined. The implementation of some of the smaller aspects of the project began in the same year and a number of them have already been concluded e.g. nine ha. of agricultural land has been converted to a naturalised area with a new bicycle path running parallel to the road. 									7. Cost and resources									The implementation of the measures to change the water level is expected to cost €12 million between 2008-12, including the costs of monitoring and the improvements that need to be made by private parties.									8. Effectiveness (i.e. were the foreseen goals/objectives of the work reached?)									Already by 2005, the opening of the dam had caused a measurable improvement in the water quality of the lake. The water is no longer brackish but saltwater and more species have colonised the lake (polyps, snails, saltwater fish) including, for the first time in many years, jellyfish. There is less sea lettuce and the water is clear and odourless. Young mussels develop in the shallow parts of the lake although they still die in the Autumn as the water level drops.									9. Success and Fail factors									There has been extensive involvement with the stakeholders (farmers, fishemen, marinas etc.) with information evenings organised. A twice yearly informative newsletter is also printed. The changes in the lake have been extensively studied over a log period of time so there is a good reliable, data base on which to build.									10. Unforeseen outcomes									None so far.									11. Prepared by									A. H. Pickaver, Coastal &amp; Marine Union (EUCC), The Netherlands									12.

Second, we will test predictions concerning the resistance and resilience of SADs by a comparative analysis of existing data sets (that encompass communities in terrestrial, freshwater and marine environments for ecosystems extending from the poles to the tropics) and through a new field experiment that quantifies temporal turnover across a community (unicellular organisms to vertebrates) in relation to factors both natural (dispersal limitation) and anthropogenic (human disturbance) thought to shape SADs. In the final part of the project we will apply these new insights into the temporal dynamics of SADs to two important conservation challenges. These are 1) the conservation of biodiversity in a heavily utilized European landscape (Fife, Scotland) and 2) the conservation of biodiversity in Mamirauá and Amaña reserves in Amazonian flooded forest.  Taken together this research will not only shed new light on the structure of ecological communities but will also aid conservation.

Waves are the main factor shaping the coast and climate change affects the wave regime. This project shows how the wave regime will change and what effects it will have on the coast, such as sea level rise and beach retreating, changes in wave direction causing a beach to swing with the subsequent sediment loss and beach retreatment, etc. The analysis offers results about the coast, including the insecurity infrastructures to face climate change effects, etc.   									4. Overview of the case									This project aims to provide the Ministry of Environment with the scientific knowledge, methodologies and tools to propose and design strategies to tackle climate change effects along the Spanish Coast. 									5. Context and Objectives									a) Context									The Spanish State, just like the other Member States, is required by the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) to implement specific measures to adapt to sea level rise and climate change effects on the coast. Specifically, the UNFCCC establishes that all Parties must formulate, apply, publish and regularly update national programmes which include measures to ease climate change adaptation. The Directorate General for Quality and Environmental Assessment, from the Ministry of Environment and through its Spanish Agency for Climate Change, is responsible for developing the Spanish policies on Climate Change and therefore must meet the requirements imposed by the UNFCCC. The lack of scientific studies and tools to support the public policies and strategies on climate change was the main driving force of this project. This initiative has been developed at the national level.									b) Objectives									The main objective was to define and establish the scientific, technical and economic mechanisms to provide the Ministry of Environment with the scientific knowledge required to establish adequate policies and strategies regarding climate change for the Spanish coasts. There were 3 specific objectives: (1) evaluation of changes in Spanish coastal dynamics, (2) assessment of the effects that climate change and related coastal dynamics can produce in the natural areas and human uses along the Spanish coast, and (3) establishment of policies and strategies to tackle climate change effects. The timescale associated with implementation and goals achievement was 2 years (2004-2006)									6. Implementation of the ICZM Approach (i.e. management, tools, resources)									a) Management									The Ministry of Environment (through its Spanish Office for Climate Change, from the Directorate General for Quality and Environmental Assessment) is the institution demanding and funding the project. The University of Cantabria (through its Environmental Hydraulics Institute IH Cantabria) is the technical research group developing the work.									b) ICZM tools									This technical tool is the base to develop an adequate coastal planning considering climate change effects. The technical tool is based on a collaboration agreement between the Directorate General for Quality and Environmental Assessment and the University of Cantabria in terms of “Research on the Impacts of Climate Change on the Spanish Coastal zone”, signed in 2002. 									The specific tasks carried out were the following:					                					Compilation of data and informationTechnical analysis of coastal data and dynamicsMorphological zoning of the Spanish coastAnalysis of climate change effects on the Spanish coastProposal of a set of indicators to provide objective information for the establishment of policies and strategies to prevent, mitigate or adapt to climate change effects on the Spanish coast.Proposal of strategic actions to tackle climate change effects:Increase the knowledge on the driving forces produced by climate change and on the methodologies to analyse themQuantitative and qualitative analyses of the vulnerability of the coastal zoneSocial awareness of the problem caused by climate change effectsClimate change effect mitigation through indirect actionsCoastal Setback strategiesCoastal Adaptation strategiesCoastal Protection strategies.                    									7. Cost and resources									The budget for the design and implementation of this tool was €600.000. The manpower used for the implementation of the project was approximately 10 people.									8. Effectiveness (i.e. were the foreseen goals/objectives of the work reached?)									The general objective of providing scientific knowledge and tools to the competent administration was achieved, as well as the specific objectives of the project.									9. Success and Fail factors									Factors that were helpful in achieving the objective were the support and the willingness of the Directorate General for Quality and Environmental Assessment to develop this tool and the availability of budget. The fact that the UNFCCC required the Member States to include climate change in their coastal planning; the awareness of the Ministry of Environment about climate change and the effects of rising sea levels; and the willingness of the Spanish institutions and research centres to share their data.									Factors that hindered the achievement of the goals were: the lack of long-term data about some important parameters for especially vulnerable areas (i.e. the low-lying Ebro Delta and the National Park of Doñana), such as subsidence data; the widespread social awareness about climate change and the access to information (which although apparently positive) result in the use of scientific information by non scientific people. This makes for inexact scientific information and data transmission, distortion of the scientific results, and loss of value and lack of trust in the scientific research.									10.

2. WHY DO WE NEED AN ADAPTATION STRATEGY? WHY AT EU LEVEL?

2.1 The impact of a changing climate

The severity of the impacts of climate change varies by region. The most vulnerable regions in Europe are Southern Europe, the Mediterranean Basin, Outermost regions and the Arctic. Furthermore, mountain areas in particular the Alps, islands, coastal and urban areas and densely populated floodplains are facing particular problems. Outside Europe, developing countries (including small island states) will remain particularly vulnerable.

Climate change will impact a number of sectors. In agriculture projected climatic changes will affect crop yields, livestock management and the location of production. The increasing likelihood and severity of extreme weather events will considerably increase the risk of crop failure. Climate change will also affect soil by depleting organic matter – a major contributor to soil fertility. The effects of climate change on forests are likely to include changes in forest health and productivity and changes to the geographic range of certain tree species. Climate change will be an added stress for the fisheries and aquaculture sectors. Effects will also be severe on coasts and marine ecosystems. Coastal erosion rates will increase and existing defences may provide insufficient protection. In this context, islands and outermost regions deserve special consideration.

In the energy sector, climate change will have a direct effect on both the supply and demand of energy. The projected impact of climate change on precipitation and glacier melt indicate that hydropower production could increase by 5% or more in northern Europe and decrease by 25% or more in southern Europe[7]. Decreased precipitation and heat waves are also expected to influence negatively the cooling process of thermal power plants. On the demand side, increasing summer peaks for cooling and impacts from extreme weather events will affect in particular electricity distribution.

Extreme climate events cause huge economic and social impacts. Infrastructure (buildings, transport, energy and water supply) is affected, posing a specific threat to densely populated areas. The situation could be exacerbated by the rise in sea level. A more strategic and long-term approach to spatial planning will be necessary, both on land and on marine areas, including in transport, regional development, industry, tourism and energy policies.

Tourism is likely to suffer from decreasing snow cover in Alpine areas and from increasing temperatures in Mediterranean regions. Unsustainable forms of tourism can exacerbate the negative effects of climate change.

Changing weather conditions will also have profound effects on human health and on animal and plant health . As extreme events become more frequent, weather-related deaths and diseases could rise. Climate change could also increase the spread of serious infectious vector-borne transmissible diseases including zoonoses[8]. Climate change will threaten animal wellbeing and could also impact plant health, favouring new or migrant harmful organisms, which could adversely affect trade in animals, plants and their products.

Climate change will cause significant changes in the quality and availability of water resources , affecting many sectors including food production, where water plays a crucial role. More than 80% of agricultural land is rain-fed. Food production also depends on available water resources for irrigation. Limited water availability already poses a problem in many parts of Europe and the situation is likely to deteriorate further due to climate change, with Europe’s high water stress areas expected to increase from 19% today to 35% by the 2070s. This could also increase migration pressures.

Climate change will increasingly drive ecosystem including marine ecosystems and biodiversity loss, affecting individual species and significantly impacting ecosystems and their related services, on which society depends. Ecosystems play a direct role in climate regulation with peat lands, wetlands and the deep sea providing significant storage for carbon. In addition, salt marsh ecosystems and dunes provide protection against storms. Other ecosystem services will also be affected such as the provision of drinking water, food production and building materials and oceans can deteriorate through acidification. Some land use practices and planning decisions (e.g. construction on flood plains), as well as unsustainable use of the sea (e.g. overfishing) have rendered ecosystems and socioeconomic systems more vulnerable to climate change and thus less capable of adapting.

The challenge for policy-makers is to understand these climate change impacts and to develop and implement policies to ensure an optimal level of adaptation. Strategies focused on managing and conserving water, land and biological resources to maintain and restore healthy, effectively functioning and climate change-resilient ecosystems are one way to deal with the impact and can also contribute to the prevention of disaster as addressed in a recent Commission Communication[9]. Evidence[10] suggests that working with nature’s capacity to absorb or control impact in urban and rural areas can be a more efficient way of adapting than simply focusing on physical infrastructure. Green Infrastructure[11] can play a crucial role in adaptation in providing essential resources for social and economic purposes under extreme climatic conditions. Examples include improving the soil’s carbon and water storage capacity, and conserving water in natural systems to alleviate the effect of droughts and to prevent floods, soil erosion and desertification.

- 2.2 The economic case for a strategic approach to adaptation

Some individuals or businesses ( insectors, such as agriculture and tourism) may be able to respond to market signals or environmental changes brought about by climate change (''autonomous adaptation''). However, this autonomous adaptation is unlikely to be optimal because of uncertainty, imperfect information or indeed financial constraints. This means that we cannot leave adaptation efforts to individuals or businesses.

In addition, some adaptation actions that are taken may increase vulnerability rather than reduce it. Some examples of this "mal-adaptation" are sea level rise or flood protection infrastructure that may disturb the natural dynamic nature of coastal and river systems, or cooling or water supply technologies that may increase energy consumption.

Preventive action brings clear economic, environmental and social benefits by anticipating potential impacts and minimising threats to ecosystems, human health, economy and infrastructure. Although more specific information on the costs of adaptation is needed, several sources[12] already indicate that the costs of taking action to address climate change (including mitigation and adaptation measures) will be much lower than the costs of inaction over the medium to long term.

2.3 Why is action needed at EU level?

Due to the regional variability and severity of climate impact most adaptation measures will be taken at national, regional or local level. However these measures can be supported and strengthened by an integrated and coordinated approach at EU level.

The EU has a particularly strong role when the impact of climate change transcends the boundaries of individual countries (e.g. river and sea basins and bio-geographic regions). Adaptation will require solidarity[13] among EU Member States to ensure that disadvantaged regions and regions most affected by climate change will be capable of taking the measures needed to adapt. Moreover, coordinated EU action will be necessary in certain sectors (e.g. agriculture, water, biodiversity, fisheries, and energy networks) that are closely integrated at EU level through the single market and common policies.

Article 4 of the UNFCCC[14] stipulates that every effort must be made to adopt national or regional adaptation strategies. While a number of EU Member States have prepared national adaptation strategies, others have yet to do so. The EU is well placed to facilitate coordination and the exchange of best practices between Member States on climate.

3. THE PROPOSED EU FRAMEWORK: OBJECTIVES AND ACTION

The objective of the EU’s Adaptation Framework is to improve the EU’s resilience to deal with the impact of climate change. The framework will respect the principle of subsidiarity and support overarching EU objectives on sustainable development.

The EU’s framework adopts a phased approach. The intention is that phase 1 (2009-2012) will lay the ground work for preparing a comprehensive EU adaptation strategy to be implemented during phase 2, commencing in 2013.

Phase 1 will focus on four pillars of action: 1) building a solid knowledge base on the impact and consequences of climate change for the EU, 2) integrating adaptation into EU key policy areas; 3) employing a combination of policy instruments (market-based instruments, guidelines, public-private partnerships) to ensure effective delivery of adaptation and 4) stepping up international cooperation on adaptation. For phase 1 to be a success, the EU, national, regional and local authorities must cooperate closely.

The proposals set out in this paper cover actions to be taken in the first phase and are without prejudice to the future structure of the EU budget and to the current and future multi-annual financial framework.

3.1 Developing the knowledge base

To be able to take decisions on how best to adapt, it is essential to have access to reliable data on the likely impact of climate change, the associated socio-economic aspects and the costs and benefits of different adaptation options. More knowledge is needed on climate impact and vulnerability so that appropriate policy responses can be developed. The knowledge generated on adaptation should also be made available to other countries, in particular developing countries.

A considerable amount of information and research already exists, but is not shared across Member States. An effective way to improve knowledge management would be to establish a Clearing House Mechanism as an IT tool and database on climate change impact, vulnerability and best practices on adaptation. The Clearing House Mechanism would contribute to the Shared Environmental Information System[15], the collaborative initiative by the European Commission and the European Environment Agency (EEA) to establish with the Member States an integrated and shared EU-wide environmental information system[16]. The Clearing House Mechanism would also rely on geographical information provided by the Global Monitoring for Environment and Security (GMES).

A pro-active research and education policy is necessary to promote better understanding of climate change impacts and the development of skills, methods and technologies to cope with the consequences of climate. A recent Commission Staff Working Document[17] provides detailed information on research needs, including on the impacts of climate change and adaptation. Moreover, climate change will be an important issue for the recently inaugurated European Institute of Innovation and Technology which is setting up a Knowledge and Innovation Community on climate change and adaptation.

Methods, models, data sets and prediction tools, which can be enabled by information and communication technologies, assist in understanding and forecasting climate impact, in identifying vulnerabilities and in developing appropriate adaptation measures. Further work is necessary to develop these tools. In cooperation with the Member States, vulnerability must be assessed against a wide range of climate scenarios and on different geographical scales so that adaptation measures can be defined as precisely as possible. The Commission is currently examining ways to improve the monitoring of impacts and adaptation measures in order to develop vulnerability indicators. More quantified information on the costs and benefits of adaptation is also urgently needed.

In addition, coordination should be enhanced where Member States spearhead important adaptation research.

Action (EU and Member States) Take the necessary steps to establish by 2011 a Clearing House Mechanism Develop methods, models, data sets and prediction tools by 2011 Develop indicators to better monitor the impact of climate change, including vulnerability impacts, and progress on adaptation by 2011 Assess the cost and benefit of adaptation options by 2011 |

- 3.2 Integrating adaptation into EU policies

Adaptation needs to be mainstreamed into EU policies. This exercise has to be carefully prepared, based on solid scientific and economic analysis. In each policy area there should be a review of how policies could be re-focused or amended to facilitate adaptation. Adaptation options will vary by sector and will, in some cases, require financing. For each sector, further work needs to be done to improve understanding of the impact of climate change, assess appropriate responses and secure the necessary funding. This review should commence during Phase 1(2009-2012).

In each policy area, the following key questions must be answered:

- What are the actual and potential impacts of climate change in the sector?

- What are the costs of action/inaction?

- How do proposed measures impact upon and interact with policies in other sectors?

Notwithstanding these questions, in view of the projected impact, particularly on key EU policy sectors, early action on adaptation is essential. The sectors below are those with strong EU policy involvement for which adaptation strategies outlining the types of action are needed. Priority should be given to adaptation measures that would generate net social and/or economic benefits irrespective of uncertainty in future forecasts (no-regret measures). Priority should also be given to measures that are beneficial for both mitigation and adaptation.

3.2.1 Increasing the resilience of health and social policies

The EU Health Strategy[18] foresees action on adaptation. While main policy actions should be taken by the Member States, the EU should use measures to assist Member States under the EU Health Programme[19]and through other means in accordance with article 152 of the Treaty[20]. It should explore with the WHO and EU agencies ways of ensuring adequate surveillance and control of the impact of climate change on health, such as epidemiological surveillance, the control of communicable diseases and the effect of extreme events. Further details are provided in a specific working document on health and adaptation to climate change.

The impact on animal health will need to be addressed principally at farm level but also in relation to animal population density in certain regions and current movement patterns of live animals. The Community Animal Health Strategy[21] aims to prioritise disease control, improve data gathering and step up existing animal disease surveillance. It focuses on disease prevention such as bio-security rather than reactive measures and will consider how climate change affects the occurrence of diseases.

In the social domain, there is mounting evidence that those who have fewer resources are more vulnerable to climate change effects. It is vital for the success of adaptation policies that they distribute the burdens equitably and that impacts on jobs and on the quality of life of low-income groups are taken into account. The social dimension of adaptation policies needs to be pursued within existing EU processes in the social and employment fields, and all social partners need to be involved.

Action (EU and Member States) Develop guidelines and surveillance mechanisms on the health impacts of climate change by 2011. Step up existing animal disease surveillance and control systems. Assess the impacts of climate change and adaptation policies on employment and on the well-being of vulnerable social groups. |

- 3.2.2 Increasing the resilience of agriculture and forests

As the majority of land in the EU is managed by farmers, the CAP is well placed to play a central role in contributing to adaptation, not only by helping farmers to adapt their production to the changing climate situation, but also by helping provide wider ecosystem services dependant on specific land management. In this sense, Member States should be encouraged to embed climate change adaptation in the three strands of rural development aimed at improving competitiveness, the environment, and the quality of life in rural areas. In addition, the applicability of measures on a territorial scale beyond the farm level could be examined. The Farm Advisory System could be used to disseminate knowledge and encourage the adoption of new farm management methods and technologies that facilitate climate change adaptation.

More generally, consideration should be given to the CAP providing an adequate framework for sustainable production, thereby enabling the agricultural sector to deal with the challenges posed by changing climatic conditions. This will involve, inter alia, assessing which water quantity and quality requirements should be further integrated into relevant CAP instruments as well as improving the efficiency of water use by agriculture especially in water stress regions. A reflection on possible support for farms which are particularly vulnerable to the impacts of climate change could also be undertaken. Further details are provided in a specific working document on agriculture and adaptation to climate change. In any case, the possible contribution of the CAP to adaptation to climate change will also have to be examined in the context of the review of the CAP after 2013.

As regards forests, the EU forestry strategy could be updated on climate-related aspects; in the framework of the EU Forest Action Plan a debate should be launched on the options for an EU approach on forest protection and forest information systems.

Action (EU and Member States) Ensure that measures for adaptation and water management are embedded in rural development national strategies and programmes for 2007-2013 Consider how adaptation can be integrated into the 3 strands of rural development and give adequate support for sustainable production including how the CAP contributes to the efficient use of water in agriculture Examine the capacity of the Farm Advisory System to reinforce training, knowledge and adoption of new technologies that facilitate adaptation Update forestry strategy and launch debate on options for an EU approach on forest protection and forest information systems |

- 3.2.3 Increasing the resilience of biodiversity, ecosystems and water

Ecosystem services such as carbon sequestration, flood protection and protection against soil erosion are directly linked to climate change and healthy ecosystems are an essential defence against some its most extreme impacts. A comprehensive and integrated approach towards the maintenance and enhancement of ecosystems and the goods and services they provide is needed. A number of Member States have developed initiatives designed to protect their land–based and water infrastructure. Greater co-ordination at EU level could deliver additional benefits.

Regarding water, a number of existing EU policies contribute to adaptation efforts. In particular, the Water Framework Directive[22] establishes a legal framework to protect and restore clean water across Europe by 2015 and to ensure the long-term sustainable use of water. The River Basin Management Plans due in 2009 under the Directive will take into account the impacts of climate change and the next generation of plans due in 2015 should be fully climate-proofed. In addition, climate change must also be properly integrated in the implementation of the Floods Directive[23]. Full implementation of this Directive by the EU Member States will help increase resilience and facilitate adaptation efforts.

For water scarcity, the Commission will assess the need to further regulate the standards of water using equipment and water performance in agriculture, households and buildings. When reviewing in 2012 the implementation of the Water Framework Directive and the Water Scarcity and Droughts strategy[24], options for boosting the water storage capacity of ecosystems to increase drought resilience and reduce flood risks should be evaluated. A more detailed account of water issues is provided in the accompanying document.

Regarding habitats, the impact of climate change must also be factored into the management of Natura 2000[25] to ensure the diversity of and connectivity between natural areas and to allow for species migration and survival when climate conditions change. In future it may be necessary to consider establishing a permeable landscape in order to enhance the interconnectivity of natural areas.

Action (EU and Member States) Explore the possibilities to improve policies and develop measures which address biodiversity loss and climate change in an integrated manner to fully exploit co-benefits and avoid ecosystem feedbacks that accelerate global warming Develop guidelines and a set of tools (guidance and exchange of best practices) by the end of 2009 to ensure that the River Basin Management Plans (RBMP) are climate-proofed Ensure that climate change is taken into account in the implementation of the Floods Directive. Assess the need for further measures to enhance water efficiency in agriculture, households and buildings Explore the potential for policies and measures to boost ecosystem storage capacity for water in Europe Draft guidelines by 2010 on dealing with the impact of climate change on the management of Natura 2000 sites |

- 3.2.4 Increasing the resilience of coastal and marine areas

Climate change must also be properly integrated in the implementation of the Marine Strategy Framework Directive[26] which requires the achievement of good environmental status of the EU''s marine waters by 2020. Full implementation of this Directive will help increase resilience in the marine environment and facilitate adaptation efforts.

A more coherent and integrated approach to maritime and coastal planning and management is also necessary. The Integrated Maritime Policy will provide a comprehensive framework to integrate adaptation efforts coherently into sectoral and specific policies and measures. Efforts must be stepped up to ensure that the provisions in the Integrated Coastal Zone Management (ICZM) Recommendation[27] are fully respected and strengthened. The follow-up to the Roadmap for Maritime Spatial Planning[28] will incorporate adaptation to climate change in maritime and coastal management. A more detailed account of climate change and marine and coastal issues is provided in the accompanying document.

Climate change is also an additional pressure on European fisheries and should be taken into account with a view to ensuring long-term sustainability in the future reformed Common Fisheries Policy.

In order to ensure a coordinated and integrated approach to adaptation in coastal and marine areas and to take into account trans-boundary issues, the Commission will develop guidelines on best adaptation practices in coastal and marine areas.

Action (EU and Member States) Ensure that adaptation in coastal and marine areas is taken into account in the framework of the Integrated Maritime Policy, in the implementation of the Marine Strategy Framework Directive and in the reform of the Common Fisheries Policy. Develop European guidelines on adaptation in coastal and marine areas |

- 3.2.5 Increasing the resilience of production systems and physical infrastructure

Protecting existing and future infrastructure from the impact of climate change will be predominantly a Member State responsibility. The EU nevertheless has an important role in promoting best practice, via support for infrastructure development and also in developing standards for construction[29]. Improving the resilience of existing transport infrastructure and energy networks requires a common and coordinated approach for assessing the vulnerability of critical infrastructure to extreme weather events. This provides a basis for strategic choices regarding networks, back-ups and energy security, and for maintaining stable transport networks and services. Adaptation should be considered in the Strategic Energy Review process . Infrastructure projects which receive EU funding should take climate-proofing into account based on methodologies to be developed. These methodologies would then be incorporated into the TEN-T[30], TEN-E[31] guidelines and EU Cohesion Policy. The implications of making a climate impact assessment a condition for public and private investment will be explored, as will the feasibility of incorporating sustainability criteria — including taking into account climate change — into harmonised standards for construction, with for example a possible widening or extension of the existing Eurocodes. In addition, the Commission will work with Member States and stakeholders setting guidelines and exchanging good practice, to ensure that account is taken of climate change impacts when implementing the Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) and Strategic Environmental Assessment (SEA) Directives and spatial planning policies.

Action (EU and Member States) Take account of climate change impacts in the Strategic Energy Review process Develop methodologies for climate-proofing infrastructure projects and consider how these could be incorporated into the TEN-T and TEN-E guidelines and guidance on investments under Cohesion policy in the current period Explore the possibility of making climate impact assessment a condition for public and private investment Assess the feasibility of incorporating climate impacts into construction standards, such as Eurocodes Develop guidelines by 2011 to ensure that climate impacts are taken into account in the EIA and SEA Directives |

- 4. INSTRUMENTS - FINANCING

The Stern Review identified financial constraints as one of the main barriers to adaptation. Climate change is one of the priorities for the current multi-annual financial framework (2007-2013) and it is important to ensure that the available funds are used to reflect this priority. There is scope for improving the uptake of adaptation action by Member States and for targeting better the use of available financial resources and instruments. Attention should be paid to ensuring that public funding and state aid do not foster mal-adaptation.

The recently adopted European Economic Recovery Plan (EERP) contains a number of proposals relating to climate change investments. Examples include modernising European infrastructure, promoting energy efficiency in buildings and the uptake of green products[32]. These proposals will facilitate further adaptation to climate change and their results will be evaluated to determine future needs. Member States considering investment in infrastructure as a response to the economic crisis should ensure that resulting initiatives take adaptation needs fully into consideration.

In the coming years it is essential that relevant sectors develop strategies and cost estimates for adaptive actions so that they may be taken into account in future financial decisions.

Optimising the use of insurance and other financial services products could also be explored. It should be evaluated whether certain private actors/sectors (such as those providing public services , critical infrastructure) need to be covered by compulsory standard weather-related insurance. In cases where insurance is not available, for example for buildings located in flood plains, publicly supported insurance schemes may be required. Due to the cross-border effects of climate change, there may be benefits in promoting EU-wide insurance as opposed to national or regional schemes.

In any adaptation framework, consideration should be given to the role of specialised Market Based Instruments (MBIs) and public-private partnerships should be encouraged with a view to the sharing of investment, risk, reward and responsibilities between the public and private sector in the delivery of adaptation action. Examples of MBIs include incentive schemes for protecting ecosystem services or for projects enhancing the resilience of ecosystems and economic sectors in the form of Payments for Ecosystem Services (PES).

The possibility of using revenue generated from auctioning allowances under the Community greenhouse gas emission allowance trading system (the EU ETS) for adaptation purposes should be utilised. The revised Directive governing the scheme from 2013[33] provides that at least 50% of the revenue generated from auctioning allowances should be used, inter alia for adaptation in Member States and developing countries. This additional revenue will be crucial for sharing adaptation costs between the public and private sector.

Action (EU and Member States) Estimate adaptation costs for relevant policy areas so that they can be taken into account in future financial decisions Further examine the potential use of innovative funding measures for adaptation Explore the potential for insurance and other financial products to complement adaptation measures and to function as risk sharing instruments Encourage Member States to utilise the EU’s ETS revenues for adaptation purposes |

- 5. WORKING IN PARTNERSHIP WITH THE MEMBER STATES

To support cooperation on adaptation and with a view to taking this framework forward, the Commission intends to set up an Impact and Adaptation Steering Group (IASG) and provide the secretariat (after the usual evaluation of the organisational and resources impact of this action). This group will be composed of representatives from the EU Member States involved in the formulation of national and regional adaptation programmes and will consult with representatives from civil society and the scientific community.

The Steering Group will be supported by a number of technical groups, who will deal specifically with developments in key sectors (agriculture and forestry, biodiversity, water, oceans and seas, energy, health etc.).

The Steering Group will play a role in developing the four pillars identified above to help develop the EU strategy and prepare national adaptation strategies by the Member States. The Steering Group will also consider the appropriate level at which action should be best implemented.

In the initial phase the Steering Group will focus on monitoring progress in strengthening the knowledge base, in particular setting up the Clearing House Mechanism. The Steering Group will provide a coordinated approach to building the evidence base on the impact of climate change, assessing the risks of climate change for the EU, the scope for increasing climate resilience and costing risks and opportunities.

Action (EU and Member States) Take a decision to establish by 1 September 2009 an Impact and Adaptation Steering Group (IASG) to step up cooperation on adaptation Encourage the further development of National and Regional Adaptation Strategies with a view to considering mandatory adaptation strategies from 2012 |

- 6. EXTERNAL DIMENSION AND ONGOING WORK UNDER THE UNFCCC

Many countries are already enduring the impact of climate change andthere is an urgent need to work with them, in particular with neighbouring countries and the most vulnerable developing countries, to improve their resilience and capacity to adapt to adverse effects. Adaptation should be mainstreamed in all of the EU''s external policies. In trade policy adaptation should be incorporated, notably through the liberalisation of trade in environmental goods and services and in the elaboration of Free Trade Agreements (FTAs). There is a huge potential for green trade which can contribute to enhancing growth and creating jobs. The EU should explore this and the related mutual benefits in the relationship with key partners.

EU external cooperation should make a significant contribution to promoting adaptation in partner countries. Bilateral and regional financial assistance programmes will aim to integrate adaptation considerations into all relevant sectors. The ongoing review of the EU Environment Integration Strategy will be a good opportunity to emphasise the need for integrating adaptation needs, as will the Mid-Term Review of EC cooperation strategies.

With a view to supporting adaptation in developing countries, the EU is working with developing countries to facilitate effective adaptation policies. The Global Climate Change Alliance (GCCA) was launched in 2008. Through the GCCA and other programmes the EU will support developing countries in particular Least Developed Countries and Small Island Developing States.

In the UNFCCC, the EU has tabled ambitious proposals to foster adaptation in a post-2012 global agreement, notably via the comprehensive Framework for Action on Adaptation (FAA )[34].

External EU policy should also make a substantial contribution to adaptation, via water management (the EU Water Initiative and the EU-ACP Water Facility), agriculture, biodiversity, forests, desertification energy, health, social policy (including gender issues), research, coastal erosion, and disaster risk reduction[35], the latter is an essential part of successful adaptation.

Failure to adapt could have security implications. The EU is therefore strengthening its analysis and early warning systems and integrating climate change into existing tools such as conflict prevention mechanisms and security sector reform. The effects of climate change on migratory flows should also be considered in the broader EU reflection on security, development and migration policies.

Action (EU and Member States) Step-up efforts to mainstream adaptation into all EU external policies Strengthen dialogue with partner countries on adaptation issues Take the Framework for Action on Adaptation forward in the UNFCCC |

- 7. CONCLUSIONS - NEXT STEPS

ADAPTATION WILL BE A LONG AND CONTINUOUS PROCESS. IT WILL OPERATE AT ALL LEVELS AND REQUIRE CLOSE COORDINATION WITH STAKEHOLDERS. THE EU WILL SUPPORT INTERNATIONAL AND NATIONAL ADAPTATION EFFORTS ENSUR ing that there are adequate resources for efficient and cost-effective adaptation action to provide a sustainable and sound economic basis for future generations.

First, a comparative assessment of the effect of temperature on parasite population and community structure dynamics will be carried out using matched pairs control-impact design in a natural experiment setup to test the parasite numerical response hypothesis. Simultaneously, structural patterns in a free-living freshwater system, macrozoobentic communities, will be evaluated. Secondly, using the same sampling design the hypothesis of temperature-mediated alteration of pollutant metabolism will be tested by a comparative evaluation of the rates of toxic metal accumulation in selected dominant parasite and benthic invertebrate species. Identification of temporal and spatial patterns of abundance and community structure at different thermal regimes is the key to forecast the impacts of climate change on parasite communities in fish in European freshwater ecosystems. Further, linking ecological data to pollutant metabolism will provide novel insights on the response of parasite communities to environmental change which may help predict possible outcomes of host-parasite interaction and forecast minimum index values to detect pollution in the context of the effect of global warming.  The novelty of the proposed research lies in its trans-disciplinary approach linking advanced ecology and ecotoxicology concepts and methods. The quantification of the response to increased ambient temperature of the model organism groups relates not solely to issues fundamental to assessment of climate-mediated community level alterations and host-parasite interactions but to wider conceptual and applied domains such as synergism and/or antagonism among multiple stressors and pollution risk analysis using model indicator systems.

This Directive now requires Member States to assess if all water courses and coast lines are at risk from flooding, to map the flood extent and assets and humans at risk in these areas and to take adequate and coordinated measures to reduce this flood risk. With this Directive also reinforces the rights of the public to access this information and to have a say in the planning process.

The Directive was proposed by the European Commission on 18/01/2006, and was finally published in the Official Journal on 6 November 2007. Its aim is to reduce and manage the risks that floods pose to human health, the environment, cultural heritage and economic activity. The Directive requires Member States to first carry out a preliminary assessment by 2011 to identify the river basins and associated coastal areas at risk of flooding. For such zones they would then need to draw up flood risk maps by 2013 and establish flood risk management plans focused on prevention, protection and preparedness by 2015. The Directive applies to inland waters as well as all coastal waters across the whole territory of the EU. 

The Directive shall be carried out in coordination with the Water Framework Directive, notably by flood risk management plans and river basin management plans being coordinated, and through coordination of the public participation procedures in the preparation of these plans. All assessments, maps and plans prepared shall be made available to the public.

Member States shall furthermore coordinate their flood risk management practices in shared river basins, including with third counties, and shall in solidarity not undertake measures that would increase the flood risk in neighbouring countries. Member States shall in take into consideration long term developments, including climate change, as well as sustainable land use practices in the flood risk management cycle addressed in this Directive.

Background

Between 1998 and 2004, Europe suffered over 100 major damaging floods, including the catastrophic floods along the Danube and Elbe rivers in summer 2002. Severe floods in 2005 further reinforced the need for concerted action. Since 1998 floods in Europe have caused some 700 deaths, the displacement of about half a million people and at least €25 billion in insured economic losses.

Catastrophic floods endanger lives and cause human tragedy as well as heavy economic losses. Floods are natural phenomena but through the right measures we can reduce their likelihood and limit their impacts. In addition to economic and social damage, floods can have severe environmental consequences, for example when installations holding large quantities of toxic chemicals are inundated or wetland areas destroyed. The coming decades are likely to see a higher flood risk in Europe and greater economic damage.

Directive 2007/60/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council

of 23 October 2007

on the assessment and management of flood risks

(Text with EEA relevance)

THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,

Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, and in particular Article 175(1) thereof,

Having regard to the proposal from the Commission,

Having regard to the Opinion of the European Economic and Social Committee [1],

Acting in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 251 of the Treaty [2],

Whereas:

(1) Floods have the potential to cause fatalities, displacement of people and damage to the environment, to severely compromise economic development and to undermine the economic activities of the Community.

(2) Floods are natural phenomena which cannot be prevented. However, some human activities (such as increasing human settlements and economic assets in floodplains and the reduction of the natural water retention by land use) and climate change contribute to an increase in the likelihood and adverse impacts of flood events.

(3) It is feasible and desirable to reduce the risk of adverse consequences, especially for human health and life, the environment, cultural heritage, economic activity and infrastructure associated with floods. However, measures to reduce these risks should, as far as possible, be coordinated throughout a river basin if they are to be effective.

(4) Directive 2000/60/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 23 October 2000 establishing a framework for Community action in the field of water policy [3] requires river basin management plans to be developed for each river basin district in order to achieve good ecological and chemical status, and it will contribute to mitigating the effects of floods. However, reducing the risk of floods is not one of the principal objectives of that Directive, nor does it take into account the future changes in the risk of flooding as a result of climate change.

(5) The Commission Communication of 12 July 2004 to the European Parliament, the Council, the European Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of the Regions "Flood risk management — Flood prevention, protection and mitigation" sets out its analysis and approach to managing flood risks at Community level, and states that concerted and coordinated action at Community level would bring considerable added value and improve the overall level of flood protection.

(6) Effective flood prevention and mitigation requires, in addition to coordination between Member States, cooperation with third countries. This is in line with Directive 2000/60/EC and international principles of flood risk management as developed notably under the United Nations Convention on the protection and use of transboundary water courses and international lakes, approved by Council Decision 95/308/EC [4], and any succeeding agreements on its application.

(7) Council Decision 2001/792/EC, Euratom of 23 October 2001 establishing a Community mechanism to facilitate reinforced cooperation in civil protection assistance interventions [5] mobilises support and assistance from Member States in the event of major emergencies, including floods. Civil protection can provide adequate response to affected populations and improve preparedness and resilience.

(8) Under Council Regulation (EC) No 2012/2002 of 11 November 2002 establishing the European Union Solidarity Fund [6] it is possible to grant rapid financial assistance in the event of a major disaster to help the people, natural zones, regions and countries concerned to return to conditions that are as normal as possible. However the Fund may only intervene for emergency operations, and not for the phases preceding an emergency.

(9) In developing policies referring to water and land uses Member States and the Community should consider the potential impacts that such policies might have on flood risks and the management of flood risks.

(10) Throughout the Community different types of floods occur, such as river floods, flash floods, urban floods and floods from the sea in coastal areas. The damage caused by flood events may also vary across the countries and regions of the Community. Hence, objectives regarding the management of flood risks should be determined by the Member States themselves and should be based on local and regional circumstances.

(11) Flood risks in certain areas within the Community could be considered not to be significant, for example in thinly populated or unpopulated areas or in areas with limited economic assets or ecological value. In each river basin district or unit of management the flood risks and need for further action — such as the evaluation of flood mitigation potential — should be assessed.

(12) In order to have available an effective tool for information, as well as a valuable basis for priority setting and further technical, financial and political decisions regarding flood risk management, it is necessary to provide for the establishing of flood hazard maps and flood risk maps showing the potential adverse consequences associated with different flood scenarios, including information on potential sources of environmental pollution as a consequence of floods. In this context, Member States should assess activities that have the effect of increasing flood risks.

(13) With a view to avoiding and reducing the adverse impacts of floods in the area concerned it is appropriate to provide for flood risk management plans. The causes and consequences of flood events vary across the countries and regions of the Community. Flood risk management plans should therefore take into account the particular characteristics of the areas they cover and provide for tailored solutions according to the needs and priorities of those areas, whilst ensuring relevant coordination within river basin districts and promoting the achievement of environmental objectives laid down in Community legislation. In particular, Member States should refrain from taking measures or engaging in actions which significantly increase the risk of flooding in other Member States, unless these measures have been coordinated and an agreed solution has been found among the Member States concerned.

(14) Flood risk management plans should focus on prevention, protection and preparedness. With a view to giving rivers more space, they should consider where possible the maintenance and/or restoration of floodplains, as well as measures to prevent and reduce damage to human health, the environment, cultural heritage and economic activity. The elements of flood risk management plans should be periodically reviewed and if necessary updated, taking into account the likely impacts of climate change on the occurrence of floods.

(15) The solidarity principle is very important in the context of flood risk management. In the light of it Member States should be encouraged to seek a fair sharing of responsibilities, when measures are jointly decided for the common benefit, as regards flood risk management along water courses.

(16) To prevent duplication of work, Member States should be entitled to use existing preliminary flood risk assessments, flood hazard and risk maps and flood risk management plans for the purposes of achieving the objectives and satisfying the requirements of this Directive.

(17) Development of river basin management plans under Directive 2000/60/EC and of flood risk management plans under this Directive are elements of integrated river basin management. The two processes should therefore use the mutual potential for common synergies and benefits, having regard to the environmental objectives of Directive 2000/60/EC, ensuring efficiency and wise use of resources while recognising that the competent authorities and management units might be different under this Directive and Directive 2000/60/EC.

(18) Member States should base their assessments, maps and plans on appropriate "best practice" and "best available technologies" not entailing excessive costs in the field of flood risk management.

(19) In cases of multi-purpose use of bodies of water for different forms of sustainable human activities (e.g. flood risk management, ecology, inland navigation or hydropower) and the impacts of such use on the bodies of water, Directive 2000/60/EC provides for a clear and transparent process for addressing such uses and impacts, including possible exemptions from the objectives of "good status" or of "non-deterioration" in Article 4 thereof. Directive 2000/60/EC provides for cost recovery in Article 9.

(20) The measures necessary for the implementation of this Directive should be adopted in accordance with Council Decision 1999/468/EC of 28 June 1999 laying down the procedures for the exercise of implementing powers conferred on the Commission [7].

(21) In particular, the Commission should be empowered to adapt the Annex to scientific and technical progress. Since those measures are of general scope and are designed to amend non-essential elements of this Directive, they must be adopted in accordance with the regulatory procedure with scrutiny provided for in Article 5a of Decision 1999/468/EC.

(22) This Directive respects the fundamental rights and observes the principles recognised in particular by the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union. In particular, it seeks to promote the integration into Community policies of a high level of environmental protection in accordance with the principle of sustainable development as laid down in Article 37 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union.

(23) Since the objective of this Directive, namely the establishment of a framework for measures to reduce the risks of flood damage, cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States and can by reason of scale and effects of actions be better achieved at Community level, the Community may adopt measures, in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity as set out in Article 5 of the Treaty. In accordance with the principle of proportionality, as set out in that Article, this Directive does not go beyond what is necessary in order to achieve that objective.

(24) In accordance with the principles of proportionality and subsidiarity and the Protocol on the application of the principles of subsidiarity and proportionality attached to the Treaty, and in view of existing capabilities of Member States, considerable flexibility should be left to the local and regional levels, in particular as regards organisation and responsibility of authorities.

(25) In accordance with point 34 of the Interinstitutional Agreement on better law-making [8], Member States are encouraged to draw up, for themselves and in the interest of the Community, their own tables illustrating, as far as possible, the correlation between this Directive and the transposition measures, and to make them public,

HAVE ADOPTED THIS DIRECTIVE:

CHAPTER I

GENERAL PROVISIONS

Article 1

The purpose of this Directive is to establish a framework for the assessment and management of flood risks, aiming at the reduction of the adverse consequences for human health, the environment, cultural heritage and economic activity associated with floods in the Community.

Article 2

For the purpose of this Directive, in addition to the definitions of "river", "river basin", "sub-basin" and "river basin district" as set out in Article 2 of Directive 2000/60/EC, the following definitions shall apply:

1. "flood" means the temporary covering by water of land not normally covered by water. This shall include floods from rivers, mountain torrents, Mediterranean ephemeral water courses, and floods from the sea in coastal areas, and may exclude floods from sewerage systems;

2. "flood risk" means the combination of the probability of a flood event and of the potential adverse consequences for human health, the environment, cultural heritage and economic activity associated with a flood event.

Article 3

1. For the purposes of this Directive Member States shall make use of the arrangements made under Article 3(1), (2), (3), (5) and (6) of Directive 2000/60/EC.

2. However, for the implementation of this Directive, Member States may:

(a) appoint competent authorities different from those identified pursuant to Article 3(2) of Directive 2000/60/EC;

(b) identify certain coastal areas or individual river basins and assign them to a unit of management different from those assigned pursuant to Article 3(1) of Directive 2000/60/EC.

In these cases, Member States shall, by 26 May 2010, communicate to the Commission the information referred to in Annex I to Directive 2000/60/EC. For this purpose, any reference to competent authorities and river basin districts shall be taken as references to the competent authorities and unit of management referred to in this Article. Member States shall inform the Commission of any changes in the information provided pursuant to this paragraph within three months of the change coming into effect.

CHAPTER II

PRELIMINARY FLOOD RISK ASSESSMENT

Article 4

1. Member States shall, for each river basin district, or unit of management referred to in Article 3(2)(b), or the portion of an international river basin district lying within their territory, undertake a preliminary flood risk assessment in accordance with paragraph 2 of this Article.

2. Based on available or readily derivable information, such as records and studies on long term developments, in particular impacts of climate change on the occurrence of floods, a preliminary flood risk assessment shall be undertaken to provide an assessment of potential risks. The assessment shall include at least the following:

(a) maps of the river basin district at the appropriate scale including the borders of the river basins, sub-basins and, where existing, coastal areas, showing topography and land use;

(b) a description of the floods which have occurred in the past and which had significant adverse impacts on human health, the environment, cultural heritage and economic activity and for which the likelihood of similar future events is still relevant, including their flood extent and conveyance routes and an assessment of the adverse impacts they have entailed;

(c) a description of the significant floods which have occurred in the past, where significant adverse consequences of similar future events might be envisaged;

and, depending on the specific needs of Member States, it shall include:

(d) an assessment of the potential adverse consequences of future floods for human health, the environment, cultural heritage and economic activity, taking into account as far as possible issues such as the topography, the position of watercourses and their general hydrological and geo-morphological characteristics, including floodplains as natural retention areas, the effectiveness of existing man-made flood defence infrastructures, the position of populated areas, areas of economic activity and long-term developments including impacts of climate change on the occurrence of floods.

3. In the case of international river basin districts, or units of management referred to in Article 3(2)(b) which are shared with other Member States, Member States shall ensure that exchange of relevant information takes place between the competent authorities concerned.

4. Member States shall complete the preliminary flood risk assessment by 22 December 2011.

Article 5

1. On the basis of a preliminary flood risk assessment as referred to in Article 4, Member States shall, for each river basin district, or unit of management referred to in Article 3(2)(b), or portion of an international river basin district lying within their territory, identify those areas for which they conclude that potential significant flood risks exist or might be considered likely to occur.

2. The identification under paragraph 1 of areas belonging to an international river basin district, or to a unit of management referred to in Article 3(2)(b) shared with another Member State, shall be coordinated between the Member States concerned.

CHAPTER III

FLOOD HAZARD MAPS AND FLOOD RISK MAPS

Article 6

1. Member States shall, at the level of the river basin district, or unit of management referred to in Article 3(2)(b), prepare flood hazard maps and flood risk maps, at the most appropriate scale for the areas identified under Article 5(1).

2. The preparation of flood hazard maps and flood risk maps for areas identified under Article 5 which are shared with other Member States shall be subject to prior exchange of information between the Member States concerned.

3. Flood hazard maps shall cover the geographical areas which could be flooded according to the following scenarios:

(a) floods with a low probability, or extreme event scenarios;

(b) floods with a medium probability (likely return period ≥ 100 years);

(c) floods with a high probability, where appropriate.

4. For each scenario referred to in paragraph 3 the following elements shall be shown:

(a) the flood extent;

(b) water depths or water level, as appropriate;

(c) where appropriate, the flow velocity or the relevant water flow.

5. Flood risk maps shall show the potential adverse consequences associated with flood scenarios referred to in paragraph 3 and expressed in terms of the following:

(a) the indicative number of inhabitants potentially affected;

(b) type of economic activity of the area potentially affected;

(c) installations as referred to in Annex I to Council Directive 96/61/EC of 24 September 1996 concerning integrated pollution prevention and control [9] which might cause accidental pollution in case of flooding and potentially affected protected areas identified in Annex IV(1)(i), (iii) and (v) to Directive 2000/60/EC;

(d) other information which the Member State considers useful such as the indication of areas where floods with a high content of transported sediments and debris floods can occur and information on other significant sources of pollution.

6. Member States may decide that, for coastal areas where an adequate level of protection is in place, the preparation of flood hazard maps shall be limited to the scenario referred to in paragraph 3(a).

7. Member States may decide that, for areas where flooding is from groundwater sources, the preparation of flood hazard maps shall be limited to the scenario referred to in paragraph 3(a).

8. Member States shall ensure that the flood hazard maps and flood risk maps are completed by 22 December 2013.

CHAPTER IV

FLOOD RISK MANAGEMENT PLANS

Article 7

1. On the basis of the maps referred to in Article 6, Member States shall establish flood risk management plans coordinated at the level of the river basin district, or unit of management referred to in Article 3(2)(b), for the areas identified under Article 5(1) and the areas covered by Article 13(1)(b) in accordance with paragraphs 2 and 3 of this Article.

2. Member States shall establish appropriate objectives for the management of flood risks for the areas identified under Article 5(1) and the areas covered by Article 13(1)(b), focusing on the reduction of potential adverse consequences of flooding for human health, the environment, cultural heritage and economic activity, and, if considered appropriate, on non-structural initiatives and/or on the reduction of the likelihood of flooding.

3. Flood risk management plans shall include measures for achieving the objectives established in accordance with paragraph 2 and shall include the components set out in Part A of the Annex.

Flood risk management plans shall take into account relevant aspects such as costs and benefits, flood extent and flood conveyance routes and areas which have the potential to retain flood water, such as natural floodplains, the environmental objectives of Article 4 of Directive 2000/60/EC, soil and water management, spatial planning, land use, nature conservation, navigation and port infrastructure.

Flood risk management plans shall address all aspects of flood risk management focusing on prevention, protection, preparedness, including flood forecasts and early warning systems and taking into account the characteristics of the particular river basin or sub-basin. Flood risk management plans may also include the promotion of sustainable land use practices, improvement of water retention as well as the controlled flooding of certain areas in the case of a flood event.

4. In the interests of solidarity, flood risk management plans established in one Member State shall not include measures which, by their extent and impact, significantly increase flood risks upstream or downstream of other countries in the same river basin or sub-basin, unless these measures have been coordinated and an agreed solution has been found among the Member States concerned in the framework of Article 8.

5. Member States shall ensure that flood risk management plans are completed and published by 22 December 2015.

Article 8

1. For river basin districts, or units of management referred to in Article 3(2)(b), which fall entirely within their territory, Member States shall ensure that one single flood risk management plan, or a set of flood risk management plans coordinated at the level of the river basin district, is produced.

2. Where an international river basin district, or unit of management referred to in Article 3(2)(b), falls entirely within the Community, Member States shall ensure coordination with the aim of producing one single international flood risk management plan, or a set of flood risk management plans coordinated at the level of the international river basin district. Where such plans are not produced, Member States shall produce flood risk management plans covering at least the parts of the international river basin district falling within their territory, as far as possible coordinated at the level of the international river basin district.

3. Where an international river basin district, or unit of management referred to in Article 3(2)(b), extends beyond the boundaries of the Community, Member States shall endeavour to produce one single international flood risk management plan or a set of flood risk management plans coordinated at the level of the international river basin district; where this is not possible, paragraph 2 shall apply for the parts of the international river basin falling within their territory.

4. The flood risk management plans referred to in paragraphs 2 and 3 shall be supplemented, where considered appropriate by countries sharing a sub-basin, by more detailed flood risk management plans coordinated at the level of the international sub-basins.

5. Where a Member State identifies an issue which has an impact on the management of flood risks of its water and that issue cannot be resolved by that Member State, it may report the issue to the Commission and any other Member State concerned and may make recommendations as to how the issue should be resolved.

The Commission shall respond to any report or recommendations from Member States within a period of six months.

CHAPTER V

COORDINATION WITH DIRECTIVE 2000/60/EC, PUBLIC INFORMATION AND CONSULTATION

Article 9

Member States shall take appropriate steps to coordinate the application of this Directive and that of Directive 2000/60/EC focusing on opportunities for improving efficiency, information exchange and for achieving common synergies and benefits having regard to the environmental objectives laid down in Article 4 of Directive 2000/60/EC. In particular:

1. the development of the first flood hazard maps and flood risk maps and their subsequent reviews as referred to in Articles 6 and 14 of this Directive shall be carried out in such a way that the information they contain is consistent with relevant information presented according to Directive 2000/60/EC. They shall be coordinated with, and may be integrated into, the reviews provided for in Article 5(2) of Directive 2000/60/EC;

2. the development of the first flood risk management plans and their subsequent reviews as referred to in Articles 7 and 14 of this Directive shall be carried out in coordination with, and may be integrated into, the reviews of the river basin management plans provided for in Article 13(7) of Directive 2000/60/EC;

3. the active involvement of all interested parties under Article 10 of this Directive shall be coordinated, as appropriate, with the active involvement of interested parties under Article 14 of Directive 2000/60/EC.

The tool must include many different high quality layers of information in order to be successfully applied. It will be developed in the framework of a “Web-based Spatial Decision Supporting System” (WS-DSS) and will consider soil and landscape. The WS-DSS tool will, through a web server system, provide advice and enable users to produce detailed spatial documents, reports and maps on a series of issues such as agriculture, environment and climate change, with the ultimate goal of enabling an easy implementation and an innovative spatial based adoption of relevant EU and national legislation. WS-DSS will be adopted in a test area (and further expanded, after the project) by the agricultural division of the Region of Campania, an associate partner. Moreover, during the lifetime of the project, the tool will be provided for testing in four other European regions that have already expressed an interest.

As a non-renewable important resource to the European identity, sustainable adaptation strategies are required for long term preservation. For this purpose and for the first time ever, the CLIMATE FOR CULTURE project will couple completely new high resolution (10x10km) climate change evolution scenarios with whole building simulation models to identify the risks for specific regions. The innovation lies in the elaboration of a more reliable damage assessment by connecting the future climate data with whole building simulation models and new damage assessment functions.
 In situ measurements at UNESCO sites throughout Europe will allow a much more precise and integrated assessment of the real damage impact of climate change on cultural heritage. Appropriate sustainable mitigation/adaptation strategies, also from previous projects, are further developed and applied on the basis of these findings simultaneously. All these results will be incorporated into an assessment of the economic impacts. In order to ensure an efficient use of resources, this project will build on the results of already concluded EU research projects (Noah s Ark). The final achievement of the project will be a macro-economic impact report on cultural heritage in the times of climate change akin to the STERN report which would be a truly European contribution to future IPCC Reports.

Among the most apparent effects of climate change are alterations in the phenology of many species as a result of changes in the timing of seasons. One of the most striking examples concerns the life-cycle of migratory birds: during recent decades a growing number of studies have reported a direct relationship between climate change and bird migration phenology, essentially showing that birds arrive earlier to their breeding grounds in the Northern Hemisphere, in accordance with a trend towards higher global temperature. However, the ultimate mechanisms by which these phenol-typical adaptations occur are poorly understood. Two contrasting, non-exclusive, mechanisms may account for the observed responses: a micro-evolutionary response to selection and/or phenotypic plasticity. To explore which of these mechanisms operates and when, here we propose the combined use of long-term datasets of individually-marked migratory birds, their phenotypic and life-history traits and their fitness parameters, along with climatic data and pedigree information. We propose to identify which phenotypic traits have changed over time because of the influence of climate change, by using a range of statistical analyses and mathematical modelling (capture-mark-recapture methods, linear mixed modelling). Then, we propose to study the inheritance patterns of the most-influenced phenotypic traits using pedigree information and quantitative genetics methods ( animal models ).  This combined use of ecology and evolution methodologies through heredity studies of pedigrees aims to help understand how the adaptive mechanisms to climate change take place in the particular case of bird migration.

With the measures both the waters structure was improved clearly and - quality the hare, and the Auenanbindung. These results can be regarded thus as conversion of the demand of the WRRL to the protection and/or for (again) the production  of the good ecological condition  of waters. From the redeployment of the dykes resulted besides retention area, in which the annual seasonal floods the hare can spread. Thus those remain far downward convenient areas of the river valley exempted from inundations. These rivernear flooding surfaces were left to a large extent the free Sukzession and to offer today again habitat for landscape and auentypische Flora and fauna. The University of Osnabr�ck certifies the district a numerical rise of the kinds and individuals in the animal and Pflanzenreich. Since during the conversion of the measures special value was put on the integration of the adjoining owners, the project led at the same time to large acceptance in the population and to a decartelization of the potential conflict ranges nature protection, land and water management.

Experiences that can be exchanged									Methods to find and identify pollution sources within bathing site catchments can easily be transferred to other bathing sites in the region and the EU. The impact of identified pollution sources on bathing water quality was assessed under different weather scenarios. Technical solutions to prevent contaminant introduction are suggested. For sites where technical solutions are inappropriate, a concept for a flexible warning system was developed to inform bathers of risks. 									4. Overview of the case									The study was launched to meet the future stricter EU legislation on bathing water quality. Bathing tourism plays a major economic role in all coastal areas of northern Germany. Thus, it is crucial for economic welfare to identify and prevent bathing water pollution. State, regional, and local authorities, science, stakeholders from tourism and agriculture were integrated in the process. 									5. Context and Objectives									a) Context									The German study sites were all situated in the county Rendsburg-Eckernförde in the federal state of Schleswig-Holstein. It encompasses 2,200 km2 land with 55 km Baltic Sea coast, 38 freshwater lakes. Schlei fjord and Kiel Canal form the northern and southern borders to the neighbour districts. It is a rural district with 75% agricultural land use. Agriculture and tourism are the major economies in most areas of the district. 									The initiative region belongs to the so called technology region K.E.R.N., founded in 1995 by municipalities and economic associations of the city Kiel, the county Rendsburg-Eckernförde, and the city Neumünster (total inhabitants 548,000; 242,000 of them in the state''s capital Kiel), and joined in 1996 by the county Plön that has been co-operating with the former Danish county Fyns Amt (population 465,000) for many years (a district reform dissolved Fyns Amt in 2007). The economic structure in the K.E.R.N. region is based on SMEs (small and medium sized enterprises). About 40% of the labour force belong to the service sector, about 30% to manufacturing industries, 2% to agriculture and 24% in administration and other sectors. In the past, reduced bathing water quality at some sites led to losses in tourism profit. The new European bathing water directive defines stricter threshold values for hygiene parameters. Beyond that, for each bathing site so called bathing water profiles have to be established to identify potential sources of pollution. 									b) Objectives 									The aim was to ensure an improvement of bathing water quality in the region and to prepare the bathing water profiles that are requested by the new framework directive, to provide a long-term perspective for the important tourism economy in the rural region. 									6. Implementation of the ICZM Approach (i.e. management, tools, resources)									a) Management									The responsible authorities for bathing water quality are the Schleswig-Holstein Ministries of Social Affairs, Health, the Family, Youth, and Senior Citizens and that of Agriculture, the Environment, and Rural Areas, as well as the authorities of the county Rendsburg-Eckernförde, and local communities. The Danish Environmental Centre Fyn (Miljøcenter Fyn / Trekantområdet) co-operated as an international partner in the K.E.R.N. region. Partners from state, regional, and local administration, as well as from science, and an international scientific partner cooperated for the project. 									b) ICZM tools									The work ran from January 2006 – September 2008. During the bathing season of 2006 the open Baltic Sea sites were analysed, in 2007 freshwater lake sites, and in 2008 bathing sites at the brackish fjord Schlei and the brackish Borgstedter Enge off the Kiel Canal, a major shipping canal connecting Baltic Sea and North Sea / Elbe estuary.									The environmental status of bathing sites and their catchment were analysed and sources for negative impact on water quality identified at a set of model bathing sites. Some 20 bathing sites on the open Baltic Sea coast, within the Schlei fjord, and at freshwater lakes in the coastal area were selected as study sites because these sites had encountered water quality problems in the past. The whole catchment of a given bathing water site was analysed, as well as topography, hydrology, ecology, and the agricultural environment. Potential contamination sources are: municipal and industrial wastewater treatment plants, discharge from private wastewater treatment plants, combined sewer overflows, storm water sewers, direct and diffuse discharge from agriculture and water fowl. The impact of pollution sources depends on meteorological and hydrological parameters such as sunshine, wind, outflow, current velocity, water temperature, and the capacity of sediments to retain or transport bacteria. 									Potential pollution sources were identified at these sites – point sources as well as diffuse sources – and monitored. Their impact on bathing water quality was analysed under different weather scenarios. Depending on the source of contamination, technical solutions for prevention of future contamination were suggested. Or, if a technical solution was not feasible a concept for a flexible and rapid warning response scheme to contamination was developed. The resulting risk analysis and options for action are transferable to other regions that depend on a functioning bathing water tourism and with similar reasons for water quality problems, diffuse agricultural runoff and sporadic water treatment failures. Local municipality authorities and the public participated to find possible pollution sources in each area. Communication and participation between stakeholders responsible for contamination sources on one side and tourism on the other as well as administrative authorities promoted development of integrated solutions and recommendations to the problem. 									In the county Rendsburg-Eckernförde water treatment plants (communal or private), overflows of combined wastewater and stormwater sewers, and rainwater drainages were identified as major point sources. Agriculture, and sediments were responsible for diffuse pollution, sediments due to their function to bind up to 60% of the faecal indicator bacteria. Animal manure plus precipitation was found to be a major source of enterococcal bacteria. 									7. Cost and resources									The budget was €499,300 and was part financed by ERDF funds. 									8. Effectiveness (i.e. were the foreseen goals/objectives of the work reached?)									Data for Bathing water profiles were produced at model sites, and point sources identified. Based on the study, recommendations for future risk management was developed together with stakeholders. The solutions aim at technical prevention or improved risk management by a warning system. Most important is a better monitoring of wastewater treatment plant runoff and additional measures to reduce the bacterial load. Regular maintenance and cleaning is important as well. Best practise recommendations to do so are further maturation ponds, UV-disinfection, membrane filtration, and as best bacterial reduction means, wetland construction. For bacterial load reduction of stormwater drainages soil retention filters combined with regular cleaning are helpful (to prevent re-suspension of bacteria after heavy rain). The same is true for combined sewage and drainage runoff and introduction of a storage step before that. Regular maintenance of sewage channels – requiring more personnel – could have prevented pollution due to technical failures. Agricultural diffuse sources could be easily reduced if the guidance on good agricultural practise were followed which is not always the case. More communication and awareness raising are necessary. Most objectives were achieved in due time. However, diffuse manure pollution was not clearly quantifiable. More thorough investigations are needed to clarify the impact of this pollution source. A concept for an early warning system was provided but for a working warning system more detailed analyses specific for each catchment are necessary. 									9. Success and Fail factors									It was difficult to quantify the impact of organic manuring: follow up investigations are necessary. The sediment analysis method for bound bacteria concentrated on Escherichia coli, since methodological problems in determining enterococcal bacteria density and viability bound to sediments occurred. Further communication and awareness raising in the agricultural community is necessary for future success in reducing impact of this diffuse source. 									10. Unforeseen outcomes									The analysis serves as a model for other coastal rural regions to develop bathing water profiles, and to work out recommendations for pollution prevention, and risk communication. The requirements of the Bathing Water Directive are the basis for the aims to improve water quality. 									11. Prepared by									Priv.-Doz. Dr. habil.

Overview of the case									The Graduate Programme in ICZM of the University of Cadiz provides specialized knowledge in the field of ICZM covering all the coastal sub-systems in a balanced way and giving special importance to the public participation and the administrative coordination. The course duration is 1 year. 									5. Context and Objectives									a) Context									Sustainable development of the coasts has been one of the main topics in the international agenda during the last years. ICZM has been highlighted by the scientific community as a tool to tackle the current problems of our coasts, not only those generated by the high percentage of population living in coastal areas and the enormous pressure of the different socio-economic activities but also due to the lack of administrative co-ordination and the conflicts of interests. Several regulations are pushing ICZM forward, like the recent Protocol on Integrated Coastal Zone Management in the Mediterranean, signed in Madrid in January 2008. These recent ICZM initiatives are encouraging the Member Countries to develop National Strategies on ICZM but nowadays the coastal managers and technical staff working in the competent Administrations are used to working in a traditional coastal management which does not consider the ICZM principles, as a holistic approach, administrative co-ordination, public participation, long-term and adaptive management, etc. This ICZM initiative, organized by the University of Cadiz, is designed to tackle this lack of information, education and training in ICZM of both the university students aiming to work or research these fields and professionals already working in them. Its first edition resulted from a European initiative to train the coastal managers and technical staff of the Cadiz province in ICZM, through the Nature-LIFE Initiative (03 NAT/E/000054). This initiative has been consolidated over the last years, this being the 8th edition of the Masters Programme in ICZM.									b) Objectives									The general objective is to provide the technical expertise required to face the current coastal management challenges from an integrated and sustainable development perspective. The specific objectives are related to the different capacities taught to the student: (1) coastal  integrated analysis, based on a holistic perspective of the complex systems (2) coordination and participation in different coastal management instruments, such as action plan design, public participatory processes, strategy establishment, etc., (3) providing advice and technical support to the political representatives in the management process, including decision-making, strategies selection, procedures, programmes implementation, coordinating actions, etc. The timescale associated with the course implementation is 1 year.									6. Implementation of the ICZM Approach (i.e. management, tools, resources)									a) Project Management									The Master in ICZM is directed by the University of Cadiz –School of Ocean and Environmental Sciences- and managed by its ICZM Research Group. Widely-known Spanish and international researchers and managers, as well as private companies and institutions at the national (as the Directorate General for the Coasts), regional and local levels participate in the Master’s Programme offering courses in specific topics.									b) ICZM tools									This initiative is an educational and training instrument. It is divided into 5 modules out of which 3 must be chosen, one Common and obligatory (4 months), 1 Specific (2 months) depending on the student’s speciality and 1 Practical Module (6 months):																																Common Module (obligatory): Coastal Oceanography and Dynamics, Coastal ecology, Coastal Pollution Integrated Analysis, Public Information and Participation Systems, Socio-economic basis for coastal management, coastal economic activities and land-uses.													Specific Module 1 (optional) “Integrated Planning and Management”: Coastal sustainable development- management strategies and methodologies, ICZM Projects-case studies.													Specific Module 2 (optional) “Coastal Risks”: Natural Coastal Risks and Protection measures, Human impacts and coastal vulnerability.													Practical Module 1 (optional) “Professional”: Internship in private company or Institution, Final Thesis (professionally-oriented)													Practical Module 2 (optional) “Research”: Scientific methodology, Final Thesis (research-oriented)																															It applies different educational and training tools, such as:																																Master classes													Practical lessons													Case studies													Field trips													Conflict resolution techniques																															7. Cost and resources									The budget for the implementation of this initiative is €70,000. The manpower used for the implementation of the tool is 52 people: 2 master co-ordinators and 50 master professors.									8. Effectiveness (i.e. were the foreseen goals/objectives of the work reached?)									The Master in ICZM offered by the University of Cadiz and its ICZM Research Group provides the technical expertise to face the current coastal management challenges from the integrated and sustainable development perspective. It has received the highest possible merit in education conferred by the Spanish Ministry of Education and Science, known as &quot;Mención de Calidad&quot;. The objectives are achieved each course in the timescale defined 									9. Success and Fail factors									Factors that are helpful in achieving the objective are: (1) the applied approach, at least 60% of the total hours are practical lessons; (2) the balance between the information and importance given to each coastal sub-system; (3) the real experiences provided by coastal managers at the regional, national  and international level; (4) the participative approach, as the second part of each lesson is dedicated to debate or apply the previously explained theory; (5) the long-term alliance with Latin America through students and associate teachers, (6) the European legislation pushing ICZM forward, and (7) the support of Spanish institutions (at the national and regional level) and American and Latin American experts.									10. Unforeseen outcomes									The awards received by both the Spanish Ministry of Education and Science help to spread the quality of the master. The fact of having all the coastal managers studying and debating together during the Master facilitates and encourages future coordination and collaboration between them. 									11.

1) develop a basin-wide climate adaptation strategy, coordinated transnationally, focused on water discharges and the functions influenced by them. The strategy development will take into account climate scenarios, on-going projects, existing measures and the EU Floods Directive , with a particular focus on floods & low-flows.
2) realise a set of measures against low-flows & floods, profitable for the international basin of the Meuse and that can be used by other river basins in NWE.
3) reinforce and widen the partnership between stakeholders of the Meuse basin, and increase the exchange of knowledge and experience on prevention, preparedness and protection against flood & drought risks.
4) engage the local population and stakeholders by improving their understanding of climate change, sustainable development, catchment basin functioning, risk consciousness of water hazards and the sense of belonging to a common river basin, across administrative and language borders.  *  Evaluate the socio-economic & ecological damage cost of potential future floods and low-flows in the Meuse basin. Carry out a ''climate-check'' of water management practices.
* Create natural water retention zones, taking into account climate change, ecological challenges, landscape & social benefits, for the reduction of both floods & low-flows. 
* Demonstrate how structural protections with a transnational benefit can be designed considering climate evolutions, water works of neighbouring countries within the Meuse basin, & low-flow issues.
* Promote preparedness to extreme events. Improve crisis management techniques.

Models predict a 44% increase in forest fires annually in America with a 61% increase in Canada, whilst fire seasons in boreal, temperate and Mediterranean regions will be prolonged in response to global warming. However, most predictions are based on outputs from numerical models and observed links between global warming and fire activity are essential for assessing future fire risk. This research will provide such sorely needed data by studying periods of past climate change in Earth history. Project FILE will focus on 3 key warming events: the mid-Pliocene (~3.3 million years ago (Ma)), the Palaeocene-Eocene Thermal Maximum (~55 Ma) and the Triassic-Jurassic Boundary (~200 Ma). Relationships between global warming and fire activity will be examined by: (1) compiling records of ancient fire activity using fossil charcoal abundance; (2) linking fire activity to records of vegetation change across these events; (3) assessing changes in vegetation for their flammable properties. The size, shape, density and connectivity of fossil leaves will be quantified, as these characters are known to control flammability. Modern analogues of the ancient plants will be subject to combustion experiments using state-of-the-art fire propagation apparatus. These experiments will test for differences in flammability between ecologically dominant plants, and will be undertaken in both modern and ancient atmospheric gas compositions.  Project FILE will provide data that address key concerns in the European Climate Change Programme II: Impacts and Adaptation, and The European Commission s April 2009 policy paper on Adapting to Climate Change . It targets the research goals of FP7 s Environment category and aims to help the EU cope with the effects of climate change and the associated sustainable environmental management demands.

Experiences that can be exchanged									A role for Public Participation GIS in the involvement in an important community (regeneration) waterfront project.									4. Overview of the case									The South Aberdeen Coastal Regeneration Project (SACRP) is a joint one-year environmental scoping project using Public Participation GIS to involve all members of the community in the project.									5. Context and Objectives									a) Context									The Torry and Nigg Bay lies to the east of Aberdeen in Scotland. It was a once vibrant and attractive coastal resort area of Aberdeen, and now including a Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI) and a local surfing spot. However, through increasing neglect over time and change of use the area has suffered severe environmental degradation; the area has a badly polluted burn (stream), polluted air from the local water/sewage treatment plant; a beach that is now a dumping ground; and an unattractive coastal landscape with poor scenic vistas for the local community and tourists.									The city council are seeking to develop a proposal for the regeneration of the waterfront area of Torry and Nigg Bay through the South Aberdeen Coastal Regeneration Project (SACRP). The regeneration project will ultimately be carried out in several phases. The first phase is the scoping project which seeks to examine a number of different scenarios for regenerating the area. These include the location of a new boat ramp or slipway and a coastal resource centre to develop the water activity sports amenities of Nigg Bay for educational purposes; a combined artificial reef and breakwater to protect the boat ramp, create a diving reef, and to increase marine biodiversity in the area; introduction of dune ridges at the back of the current beach; landscaping of the area using trees to hide the sewage treatment plant buildings; and a reedbed/wetland area to treat the polluted burn and to improve the aesthetics of the visual landscape and the habitat/biodiversity of the area. The impact of climate change on the area is one of the key factors in the regeneration scenarios.									b) Objectives									A major element of the regeneration project aims to explore the role of the geospatial technologies e.g. Geographical Information Systems (GIS), remote sensing, mobile data collection (GPS and GIS) and the Internet, to provide novel approaches to public participation in waterfront regeneration, optimal site selection of developments using techniques of spatial analysis, the creation of environmental databases, and a coastal atlas resource for the area.									6. Implementation of the ICZM Approach (i.e. management, tools, resources)									a) Management									Aberdeen City Council has responsibility for the regeneration scheme and is working with the Aberdeen Institute for Coastal Science and Management at the University of Aberdeen to conduct the scoping study.									b) ICZM tools									The regeneration work will be carried out in several stages following an environmental clean-up. This work will involve collaboration with local businesses e.g. the oil and gas industry, environmental agencies and bodies e.g. Scottish Natural Heritage, Scottish Environment Protection Agency , the East Grampian Coastal Partnership , the Crown Estate, and coastal ecologists and educators. 									The second phase of the project will be to develop the reed-bed and wetland area. The third phase will be to develop the boat ramp, coastal resource centre, and artificial reef.  The final phase will be to ensure the completion of the regeneration work and to ensure its sustainability in the future.									Effective and sustainable regeneration of an area requires community involvement and participation. To this end SACRP sought to embrace the local community from the outset by hosting a number of practical workshops that explore the potential for local input e.g. local knowledge, expertise, and experience knowledge into the proposals. They were carried out between September 2008 and September 2009. The workshops have been targeted at different age groups ranging from secondary school pupils, to residents and local councillors. Public Participation GIS (PPGIS) has successfully been used as a way to actively involve communities in every aspect of a regeneration project from the data collection stage, to the analysis, presentation and communication of information to the wider community. Geo-spatial data collected from a number of different sources e.g. Ordnance Survey and SeaZone (both through the Edina Marine Digimap educational licence agreement), Scottish Natural Heritage, the Macaulay Institute, Aberdeen Harbour Board, and the Eurosion project about various different aspects of the coastal environment, were stored in a GIS database and accessed using ESRI’s ArcExplorer, ArcView and ArcGIS software for display, analysis and mapping. Simple Virtual Reality (VR) techniques using Google Earth were used to visualise the different proposals and to explore the different possible locational and development scenarios. Hands-on workshops with these geo-spatial tools allowed the participants to explore and select the important spatial datasets, to identify optimal locations for features of the proposal e.g. boat ramp and coastal resource centre, to ‘plant’ screening for the sewage treatment plant, and with the aid of a 1m resolution Digital Terrain Model of the area to consider the optimum location for the proposed reed-bed and wetland area taking into account the topographic characteristics. Fly-throughs of the waterfront area using Google Earth provided an effective way to provide insight into the characteristics of the area and to engage the public in the choice of siting locations. VR was also used to develop a virtual walk along the coastal footpath focusing on exploring the local geology. Future developments will include the use of 3D Landscape Design and Visualisation software such as the World Construction Set to provide more realistic representations of the environment. More advanced VR solutions have been developed with the aid of the Macaulay Institute’s Landscape Visualisation Theatre suite which is designed to provide an environment in which workshop participants can interactively locate features in the landscape and then evaluate the proposed solution by voting with handsets. The coastal atlas will be based around the GIS customised to provide an online educational and tourist resource for the area.									7. Cost and resources									The budget for the scoping study was ca. £80,000. The regeneration of the wetland area has been estimated at £900,000.									8. Effectiveness (i.e. were the foreseen goals/objectives of the work reached?)									The project has demonstrated a practical and innovative approach to waterfront regeneration and development using and range of geospatial technologies. It has given the opportunity to work with raw data rather than pre-processed data and information.									9. Success and Fail factors									The participants selected - school pupils (14-15), parents and local councillors all had an interest in community regeneration.									Lack of interest and resistance to change of some participants could be problematic in this approach.									10. Unforeseen outcomes									11.

The key questions to be addressed are, 
* firstly, how may climate change influence human exposure to widespread environmental contaminants and, 
* secondly, how may contaminants impact occurrence of reproductive disorders as sensitive indicators of health? 

To provide affirmative answers to these questions the proposal will as a first step identify and describe mechanisms by which a changing climate may affect the exposure of Arctic and other human populations to contaminants through change in chemical use and emissions, delivery to the arctic ecosystem as well as processing within the arctic physical environment and human food chain. This work relies on modelling of existing data. Secondly, the project will expand the existing knowledge database on human exposure to polybrominated biphenylethers, perfluorinated surfactants and phthalates by analyses of 1000 biobanked serum samples collected in a EU FP5 project. Thirdly, the project will increase the limited knowledge on links between human exposure to contaminants and reproductive health. 
 This work relies on a large existing parent-child-cohort, where a follow-up survey provide new data that are fed into risk assessment. Furthermore we will perform reviews of experimental and epidemiological literature to identify critical reproductive effects and exposure-response data for selected compounds as input to the risk assessment. Finally the project will integrate data on climate induced changes in contaminant mobility and distribution and links between contaminant exposure and reproductive health into a risk evaluation providing insight into possible future risk scenarios related to global climate change.

Recent droughts observed in these basins call for the need of an efficient technology to predict medium and long-term flows for sustainable water resources management. The project developed appropriate mathematical models to represent snow-pack dynamics and snowmelt runoff. These models are expressly designed to integrate Earth Observation data and in-situ hydrological and meteorological measurements, introducing therefore a novel approach to the representation of the involved physical pro cesses in time and space. Model innovation stems with the enhanced capability of Earth Observation data to provide continuous information on state variables, that can be poorly accounted for using the traditional approach based on input-output control. Model calibration, validation and demonstration was performed for representative catchments of different geographic conditions (climate, geology, geomorphology, hydrography) in the European Alps. Models were implemented in a geo-service for tailoring data and models to different environments under an integrated, but modulated approach capable of effective addressing the specific problems raising from different stakeholders, these including water policy makers, economic (hydropower companies, irrigation schemes, municipal water supply), and social (regional, basin and municipal authorities, citizens) stakeholders.

- First research task will involve close work with stakeholders to understand how the advance modelling tools can best inform decision making. 
- Task 2 will identify the various direct and indirect modes in which climate impacts disrupt urban function and will go on to examine potential adaptation mechanisms and barriers to adaptation.
- In Task 3 new probabilistic scenarios for urban areas that are consistent with UKCIP08 will be developed. 
- Task 4 will model the relationship between climate impacts and the urban economy, in order to identify how the economy may be disrupted by climate change. By analysing change in the economy through time and interactions between economic sectors, we will understand better how the urban economy can be made more resilient.
- Task 5 will combine the economic model developed in Task 4 with a new model of the spatial planning of buildings and infrastructure in urban areas. As well as identifying concentrations of vulnerability, this will enable the simulation of potential redesign of the built environment under different scenarios of climate and other drivers such as employment and changes to the transport system.
- The final research task will, working with stakeholders, use the new understanding of the vulnerability of urban systems to analyse how adaptation of urban areas can enhance resilience over a range of timescales. The objective will be to make practical proposals for ''adaptation pathways'' for cities over the 21st Century to respond strategically to the challenges of flooding, water scarcity and extremes of heat.

The GIS can provide policies and administrations in neighbouring countries with a good basis for easily understandable scientific data for coastal planning and management									4. Overview of the case									A variety of analogue and digital data about shore line morphology, sediment transport, and changes within the last 300 years exist in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern. The data formats were standardised and collected from their distributed locations. Scientific data were included in a GIS to display temporal processes, and impact-response predictions. 									5. Context and Objectives									a) Context									The Baltic Sea shore line is changing by natural dynamic processes. About 70% of the 377 km outer coast length is dominated by erosion processes, 23% has an equal balance and the remaining 7% by accumulation processes. Coastal protection measures, constructions, and climate change influence these natural dynamic coastal processes. An implementation of ICZM into coastal protection planning and coastal management were desired but a generalised and easily usable information platform on data about  costal morphology and dynamic processes first had to be established. 									Since January 1997, the State Office for Environment and Nature in Rostock / Department Coast worked in the research programme &quot;Coastal Zone Management of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern (Germany)” to investigate the natural and human influences on coastal dynamics along the Mecklenburg-Vorpommern coast of the Baltic Sea, with a focus on coastal protection and flood control. All these data were to be integrated in the GIS coast MV. 									b) Objectives									The aim was to bring a great variety of scientific and historical data on topography, land and ocean, constructions, biotopes into a GIS in a standardised form. Easy access to the GIS and usefulness for different target user groups with diverse educational background was desired, as well as easy and quick implementation into the everyday work of the coastal protection planning departments of the StAUN Rostock. Not only data but also planning processes were to be standardised. 									6. Implementation of the ICZM Approach (i.e. management, tools, resources)									a) Management									State Office for Nature and Environment Rostock - coast / Staatliches Amt für Umwelt und Natur Rostock – Küste (StAUN Rostock). The StAUN Rostock is responsible for planning and management of coastal protection and defence measures along the whole Baltic Sea coast of the state of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern. The other partners provided mapping data. 									b) ICZM tools									The work for the implementation of the scientific data ran from January 2000-December 2002. GIS coast MV provides a technical planning tool for shoreline management for the state of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern. The GIS tool facilitates risk and hazard management, as well as  conflict management. It contains scientific data on geo-morphology and sediment transport. The GIS displays the shoreline (2 km inland) down to the 10 m depth line in 3D for spatial representations of beach and underwater structures. Coastal dynamic (temporal) processes can be displayed in 4D representation (temporal processes in three dimensions). 									A large amount of scientific data on coastal protection constructions, aerial and satellite photographs, and map data (planning and construction maps, historical topographic land and ocean maps from 1692 until today, biotope maps) were analysed, digitalised, standardised, and integrated in the GIS coast MV. CAD (computer aided drawing/design) was to be used to display 3D morphological structures. The focus was on geo-morphology and sediment dynamics. The data formats were digitalised, standardised and collected from their distributed locations. The system can display temporal processes, and thus impact-response predictions. For sound impact-response prediction and analysis, sustainable planning and management, it is crucial to have easy access to scientific data that are ideally presented in comparable unified standards. GIS coast MV provides a platform using standard software to display the integrated data in three dimensions. Thus, it can be used to display temporal processes as a response to impacts such as sea level rise. GIS coast MV can be used by different target groups within the state and in neighbouring regions. 									7. Cost and resources									The German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF) financed the work with a budget  of €800,000.									8. Effectiveness (i.e. were the foreseen goals/objectives of the work reached?)									GIS coast MV is a tool that is a useful planning instrument for different user groups (with diverse educational background) with easy and fast access because it uses standard software for display of the maps. Practical relevance is guaranteed by directly including the decision-makers in the planning and implementation of data. Data provider and users exchange experiences and needs through close interrelations. Information on conditions, dimensions, and costs of coastal protection measures are also included in the GIS. 									9. Success and Fail factors									Data management, especially the unification, and a clear and understandable display for different user groups were difficult. Data were distributed to interested persons and companies via CDs, to standardise planning processes. The software instruments became obsolete quite quickly, today all the data implemented in GIS-Küste have to be adjusted to new standards and software applications. 									10. Unforeseen outcomes									Immediate feedback by practitioners (data quality, dysfunction, demand for further content or processing, etc.) due to the quick implementation of the GIS tool into everyday work of coastal protection planners. Planning documents and licences van be produced very quickly with the help of the tool. Further data from projects of private companies and research organisations were adjusted to the digital format and integrated. New state funding could be raised for additional data acquisition. 									11. Prepared by									Priv.-Doz. Dr. habil.

They have been called ‘weak links’ and one of the most important of them is the important tourist and bulb-growing town of Noordwijk. The town has 25,000 inhabitants covering an area of 52 km2. The resort has a 14 km long sandy beach with a heavily built-up sea-front of recreation facilities, restaurants and hotels situated along two boulevards. On peak days, this population swells to four times the size and, in total, Noordwijk receives two million visitors/year. 60% of the working population are involved with tourism. Surrounding the town are open dune landscapes of which 3700 ha. have Natura 2000 status as well as 530 ha. of woodland with similar status. These areas contain 27 plant species found nowhere else in the Netherlands. Altogether some 56% of the territory is protected. Inland, behind the dunes, are bulb fields although their economic importance to the town is now second to the tourism market. Nonetheless, the Keukenhof Gardens each spring draw 800,000 visitors in a nine week spring flower festival. The town has also specialised in congress facilities to broaden the tourist product.									The coastal defence system to protect this coastal stretch was safe excepting for one weak, 125m strip of dune in front of the Palace Square. Here the dunes were less than 25m wide, insufficient to cope with a heavy storm. In order to ensure the safety for the next 50 years, structural and sustainable measures were needed. A defence system was needed that could prevent a flood event of once in ten thousand years.									b) Objectives									To strengthen the sea defence in front of the boulevard of Noordwijk.									6. Implementation of the ICZM Approach (i.e. management, tools, resources)									a) Management									Central government is responsible for coastal defences. 									b) ICZM tools									Different plans were considered to strengthen the coast of Noordwijk and originally a simple dyke was planned. However, following consultation with stakeholders in the town and under influence of the municipality, it was decided to build a dyke within the dunes so that it would not be visible. Work began in the Autumn of 2007 to broaden the dunes to a maximum of 42m in the direction of the sea. At the beginning of the current dune system, parallel to the boulevard and along its complete length, a dyke was built. This was then covered with sand to form a continuation with the dunes either side. The new dyke-in-dune has a height of 9 - 10m above the Normal Amsterdam Level (an ordnance datum) and follow the contours of the natural dunes. The height of the new dyke-in-dune system is no more than the defence line it replaced and this was possible because of the extra width of the dunes which form a buffer against the sea. In order that the broader dyke-in-dune area flows continuously with the natural dunes, extra sand was added to the coast along a stretch of three kilometers. It has been estimated that ca. 1.5 m. m3 of sand was required. Coastal sand was suppleted in a round-the-clock- operation lasting eight months. In order to protect the weak coastline during the winter-time while dyke-building was in progress, normally a time when no construction on the dunes occurs, a temporary, emergency dyke was constructed on the seaward side of the operations. The upper layer of sand from the old defence was removed and stored since it contained the seeds of the plants. It was put back in the spring after the dyke-in-dune had reached its planned height in time for them to geminate.									When the dunes were widened in the direction of the sea, they covered the previous beach for a  considerable distance. This meant that a new beach had to be created in the direction of the sea so that the width of the beach remained the same. Sand was also introduced to raise the coastline on the beach and for 800 metres out to sea. The seabed still slopes away at the same angle as in the old situation so that the water gradually becomes deeper. It simply means that the visitors have to walk a little further across the dyke-in-dune and down a gradual decline to reach the beach. The extra width of the new dune system will allow many dune species to increase in numbers as their habitat has been expanded. This plan is also a flexible one for the future since both the width of the dyke-in-dune, as well the height, can be increased if it is felt that the defence is still not strong enough.									During a storm, the dunes form the first buffer and, if the waves break through these there is a second buffer, the dyke. The top layer of the dyke is made of stone which keeps the sand underneath it in place effectively. The dyke will therefore wash away less easily than the dunes. In total, 1150m of coastline was strengthened.									7. Cost and resources									The budget was €18.2 million to be shared between central government, the Province of South Holland and the Municipality of Noordwijk. The Rijnland district water board paid 25% of the Municipality costs.									8. Effectiveness (i.e. were the foreseen goals/objectives of the work reached?)									The dyke-in-dune has a protective effect for the dune above it since paths are not cut into the dunes where the visitors walk to the beach. It has enhanced the previous landscape and joined the previously separated dune system either side of the town.									9. Success and Fail factors									The long experience which the Netherlands has built up over the decades on coastal defence and particularly the ability to build innovative schemes. The participation that took place in the planning stages and the information that was generated prior to, and during, the works. 									10. Unforeseen outcomes									Noordwijk was recipient of a QualityCoast Award in both 2007 and 2009. In both of these awards the planning and implementation of the coastal defence works were part of the criteria adjudicated									11. Prepared by									A. H. Pickaver, Coastal &amp; Marine Union (EUCC), The Netherlands 									12. Verified by									It has not been possible to verify this case.									13.

The research will: 
i) link the present knowledge to an integrated model from sources of pollution to the recipient ecosystem, 
ii) improve the understanding of pollutant leaching from different land-uses both in time and space considering also uncertainty, 
iii) develop a better understanding of how ecosystems depend on groundwater,
iv) understand how changes in land-use and climate affect the groundwater and dependent ecosystems, and 
v) develop better cost-efficient management and monitoring tools and transfer the research results to stakeholders and end-users for better management.
 GENESIS will provide tools to assess land-use and climate impacts on ground water and related ecosystems. The tools will be based on better scientific basis on 
i) groundwater flow paths, 
ii) biogeochemical processes, 
iii) methods to observe and reduce pollution,
iv) ecosystem interactions, and 
v) integrated management. 

GENESIS will provide better solutions to identify groundwater pollution changes, develop methods to assess the points for pollution trend reversal, and generate knowledge on how to protect groundwater dependent ecosystems. This sets the basis for future and better groundwater management.

Experiences that can be exchanged									Different methods of flood defences have been used in a number of areas dependent upon the circumstances.									4. Overview of the case									The Broadland Flood Alleviation Project is a long-term project to provide a range of flood defence improvements, maintenance and emergency response services within the tidal areas of the Rivers Yare, Bure, Waveney and their tributaries. The land, predominantly grazing marshes, has high environmental value and is important to the local economy through its use for farming and tourism.									5. Context and Objectives									a) Context									Situated in eastern England, Broadland comprises the Norfolk Broads, a river and lake system covering 301 km2 with seven tidal rivers, 190 km of which are navigable, and 63 broads (or lakes) mostly less than 4m deep. They originated as filled-in, mediaeval peat quarries. The area is the UK’s largest protected wetland, and is a National Park (1988). Tourism drives the economy of the Broads and is key to the economy of the East of England worth about £146.6 million in 1998 supporting the equivalent of 3,107 full-time jobs (4,350 actual jobs, including part-time and seasonal workers). Agriculture remains an important part of  the Broads’ economy. Most of Broadland today is productive farmland and used for traditional summer livestock grazing.									The Broads are particularly exposed to the impacts of rising temperatures, sea level rise and increasing wind strengths and the main threats will be flooding from tidal surges and a break in the coastal sea defences.  300 km2  of land lies below sea level and homes, agriculture, commerce and wildlife are at risk. Such impacts will require sustainable approaches to management and, therefore, the 20-year Broadland Flood Alleviation Project has begun. It is a vital mid-term holding operation, providing flexibility during its life with time to improve knowledge about the impacts of climate change in order to plan better for the longer term. The Project Area contains around 28 sites (7000 ha.) of Special Scientific Interest which will benefit from protection under European Law, either as Special Protection Areas (SPAs) or Special Areas of Conservation (SACs).									b) Objectives									The main aim is to strengthen existing flood defences and restore them to a height that existed in 1995 and make additional allowances for sea level rise and future settlement of the floodbanks. The project must carry out these improvements within the first 12 years of its work and maintain the improved system for a further 8 years. After the Project ends, the flood defence improvements must have a further life of 7 years. The Project is not seeking to prevent all flooding but to minimise the risk of the banks breaching in the event of floodwater overtopping them.									6. Implementation of the ICZM Approach (i.e. management, tools, resources)									a) Management									The Broads Authority has a statutory duty to manage the Broads for the purposes of: conserving and enhancing the natural beauty of the Broads; promoting the enjoyment of the Broads by the public; and protecting the interests of navigation. In 2001, Broadland Environmental Services Limited (BESL) was awarded a 20-year contract to undertake the Project. BESL is a consortium of two private companies, Edmund Nuttall Ltd (construction) and Halcrow Group Ltd (design and planning).									b) ICZM tools									The approach to flood management in Broadland consists mainly of bank strengthening and erosion protection. Improvement works are now being carried out in 40 individual flood areas. Much of the 240km of floodbanks have deteriorated because the material used for their construction was silty clay whilst others are threatened by erosion of the river edge by wind and waves, boatwash, normal river flows and the action of the tide. This will be exacerbated by sea level rise and the potential increase in frequency of storm events. Many floodbanks are at risk of being overtopped or are susceptible to seepage. Improvement works are being implemented through a phased programme by strengthening the existing floodbanks, replacing existing erosion protection that is in a poor condition using more environmentally acceptable methods wherever possible, providing new protection where erosion is currently threatening the integrity of the flood defences, and carrying out new works at undefended communities									The different solutions available are being applied dependent upon the circumstances. These are:																																Floodbank strengthening: involves strengthening the existing floodbanks in their present locations by putting material on the back and/or front slope. This is usually used where there is still a good bank between the river and the floodbank. The crest (top of the floodbank) is also raised to provide the agreed 1995 level.													Floodbank setback: involves building a new clay floodbank inland from the river edge with the floodbank set back far enough from the existing line of flood defence so that a new bank can be created and natural vegetation established. This is usually used where the river is already hard up against the floodbank and the flood defence is protected by erosion protection, such as piling. The existing erosion protection will then be removed once the new floodbank is in place and the new bank has become established.													Floodbank rollback: this solution is similar to setback, however, the distance the floodbank is moved inland is considerably less. It is the preferred solution when bank protection is insufficient to allow for just bank strengthening and where ground conditions do not permit full setback.																															Several types of erosion protection can be used depending on local circumstances and include asphalt matting, coconut husk rolls or matting, alder poles and reed-based products. Wherever possible, the material required is found locally. A computer model of the Broadland river system has also been developed using detailed, current survey information of river channel shape, bank height etc., as well as predictions of sea-level rise. It is used to determine what effect, if any, a particular scheme of works might have on water levels, flows and the frequency of flooding in any other part of the Project area. It is an important tool to help the project decide exactly what to do, where and how their programme of works should be phased and to test other options. The Project also uses a combination of methods to inform and include stakeholders e.g. consultation documents and questionnaires, stakeholder forums &amp; public meetings, site meetings and workshops and regular meetings with the Broads Authority. There is a website giving access to reports. 									7. Cost and resources									The contract was worth in excess of £120 million over a 20 year period. However, this cost ceiling is set so that any excessive spending in one area will result in a shortfall elsewhere. 									8. Effectiveness (i.e. were the foreseen goals/objectives of the work reached?)									To date, improvement works have been completed, or are substantially complete, in 23 of the areas comprising 89.1km strengthening, 29.5km setback, 3.7km re-piling, 15.2km other protection including asphalt matting and timber poles combined with reed &amp; 4.5km piling removal associated with setback areas. A flood event on the 9th November 2007 produced the highest recorded water levels in the Broadland river system since the devastating east coast floods in 1953. The flood defences throughout Broadland performed extremely well given the large volumes of water that spilled over many sections of bank, with only two small breaches (bank collapse). The flood defence works are providing benefit to a wide range of freshwater plants and animals that are dependant upon good water quality within the grazing marshes. There have been a considerable number of navigation benefits and enhancements.  An audit of one of the sites in a national scheme resulted in the site achieving a standard beyond that of the statutory requirements and accepted best practice.									9. Success and Fail factors									Consultation with local people and organisations is a key aspect. Funding, political will and enthusiastic people willing to co-operate are others.									10. Unforeseen outcomes									The excavation of a dyke revealed a number of vertical timbers belonging to an ancient causeway dating from the Bronze and Iron Ages. Also finds from the Roman occupation up to the 4th century AD. 									11. Prepared by									A. H. Pickaver, Coastal &amp; Marine Union (EUCC), The Netherlands 									12.

4. Overview of the case. Cross-sectoral coastal and marine data from the North and Baltic Seas provided by several coastal institutions and organizations are made available in a standardized way through the NOKIS metadata base. 									
5. Context and Objectives
a) Context. Coastal and marine data of all sorts about the North and Baltic Seas have been collected by a large number of coastal institutions and organisations. Cross-sectoral and cross-institutional access to these data had been limited due to different data formats and the scattered distribution between data holders. 
b) Objectives. The aim was to try and organise different sets of data, about the German coastal zone, from different sources and in different formats in  order to standardise them for mutual exchange and public information.									
6. Implementation of the ICZM Approach (i.e. management, tools, resources)									a) Project Management									The work was co-ordinated by the German Federal Waterways Engineering and Research Institute – Hamburg (Bundesanstalt für Wasserbau / BAW) in co-operation with data providers and users from national, regional and local coastal and marine science and engineering organizations in Northern Germany. Communication technology partners co-operated in developing the platform and optimizing software applications .  									b) ICZM tools									Existing cross-sectoral data were integrated into one metadata base using existing data pools. The project team defined a metadata standard for the coastal zone and developed a corresponding editor for the internet. The database was based on existing structures and developed involving users and data providers from coastal protection, water management, environmental protection, waterway engineering, and science. The standardised metadata improve data exchange between institutions and ease the presentation of data to the public. Since the data base is accessible via internet using open source software data provision is easy. Maintenance, development and inclusion of future data sets, GIS-files, related reports and publications is enhanced. The data base was developed from 2001 to 2004. The first step was to define metadata standards. A first version of the metadata editor was released and tested, and a discussion forum was implemented. In winter 2002 the first data visualization tool was presented with examples, the editor was developed and adjusted further. In a second step from September 2004 to October 2008 the metadata base was developed further with additional software tools and data implementation. 									An internet platform for easy and standardized cross-sectoral data access and the possibility for data exchange was created. Open source software technology based on Java was used to create the data base and viewers to avoid license fees. The platform itself is managed with the free content management system Typo3. The visualization in maps is provided by web mapping service (visualization of grid data, read only), web feature service (vector data, read and write transactions), and web coverage service (grid data, read and write transactions) for GIS-data, and a gazetteer-service for present and historical geographic names. Thus, database queries can be based on spatial maps of a geo-information system. Original data remain on local, that means distributed servers, metadata are generated locally and are then copied to the general NOKIS database. The metadata are a subset of the ISO 19115 standard for geo-spatial metadata and the standard ISO19119 for internet based services. Information is structured to answer the questions what, when, where, why, who and how. The platform offers information about the German coastal zone including abstracts of coastal journals, completed and on-going research projects, and it provides a number of recent project reports. The database is bi-lingual (German and English) to ensure international accessibility. It can be searched by keywords or free text search since the content is completely indexed. Some additional external metadata archives have been integrated into NOKIS. All metadata sets are automatically implemented into other databases such as the environmental database PortalU and the spatial database GeoPortal.Bund. Furthermore, metadata can be imported from the popular ArcGIS system and exported into other standard formats. A handbook for the use of NOKIS was developed. A tool for sediment classification, for remote sensing data, and a planning tool were implemented into NOKIS. 									7. Cost and resources									Both implementation steps were financed by the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF) with a budget (2001-2008) of € 2.66 million. 									8. Effectiveness (i.e. were the foreseen goals/objectives of the work reached?)									The NOKIS platform was successfully installed. Additional data providers and users have been attracted during the work. It uses open source software and expandable concepts without the need to acquire expensive updates and upgrades to keep up with technical development. In a second step from 2004 to 2008 online software tools were developed further and adjusted to the necessities of the different users. 									9. Success and Fail factors									After the final development of NOKIS, two of the involved institutions maintain the database, and develop it further. Metadata from the NOKIS database are automatically integrated into other relevant databases such as the environmental database PortalU and the spatial database GeoPortal.Bund. 									10. Unforeseen outcomes									Technical development during the two phases of NOKIS development proceeded very quickly. Thus, the software basis and the development of software tools were adjusted accordingly, increasing the applicability. 									11. Prepared by									Priv.-Doz. Dr. habil.

 Poland FP6  The objective of EFORWOOD is to develop a quantitative decision support tool for Sustainability Impact Assessment of the European Forestry-Wood Chain (FWC) and subsets thereof (e.g. regional), covering forestry, industrial manufacturing, and consumption and recycling. The objective will be achieved by: a) defining economic, environmental and social sustainability indicators, b) developing a tool for Sustainability Impact Assessment by integrating a set of models, c) supplying the tool with real data, aggregated as needed and appropriate, d) testing the tool in a stepwise procedure allowing adjustments to be made according to the experiences gained, e) applying the tool to assess the sustainability of the present European FWC (and subsets thereof) as well the impacts of potential major changes based on scenarios, f) making the adapted versions of the tool available to stakeholder groupings (industrial, political and others).The multi-functionality of the FWC is taken into account by using indicators to assess the sustainability of production processes and by including in the analysis the various products and services of the FWC. Wide stakeholder consultations will be used throughout the process to reach the objective. EFORWOOD will contribute to EU policies connected to the FWC, especially to the Sustainable Development Strategy. It will provide policy-makers, forest owners, the related industries and other stakeholders with a tool to strengthen the forest-based sector''s contribution towards a more sustainable Europe, thereby also improving its competitiveness. To achieve this, EFORWOOD gathers a consortium of highest-class experts, including the most representative forest-based sector confederations.

The primary objective is to provide an integrated methodology for planning sustainable defence strategies for the management of coastal erosion and flooding which addresses technical, social, economic and environmental aspects. THESEUS objectives are governed by three specific goals, which concern: (a) Risk assessment, (b) Response strategies and (c) Application.

 To integrate the best of these technical measures in a strategic policy context we will develop overarching THESEUS guidelines which will considers the environmental, social and economic issues raised in any coastal area. It is in this spirit that THESEUS will advance European and international experience in applying innovative technologies to reducing coastal risks. THESEUS activities will be carried out within a multidisciplinary framework using 8 study sites across Europe, with specific attention to the most vulnerable coastal environments such as deltas, estuaries and wetlands, where many large cities and industrial areas are located.

Experiences that can be exchanged									The application at the regional-local scale of the results and predictions of climate change effects obtained at the national scale. This initiative had to combine and tackle the general climate change problems with local-specificity, (i.e. specific problems, conflicts, personal interests, political situation, etc.) to propose adequate mitigation and adaptation measures.									4. Overview of the case									The study defines different potential climate scenarios for the Ebro Delta, analyses the vulnerability at an ecological, economical and social level, and defines the impacts and potential risks for the different components. Then an action plan for climate change adaptation is designed for each scenario.									5. Context and Objectives									a) Context									The Ebro Delta, the biggest Delta in Spain and the second largest in the Mediterranean after the Nile Delta, is located in the Ebro River mouth and was created between the XIV - XVIII centuries. This river, the second widest and most plentiful river in Spain, brings and deposits in its mouth the materials transported from its sources in the Pyrenees, Iberic System and Cantabrian Mountain Chain. The deposits have formed a 320km2 arrow which penetrates 22 km offshore in the Mediterranean Sea. This wetland is very rich in terms of ecological values, being an internationally important site for 8 plant species and 69 fauna species, most of them birds, hosting half of the total birds in Europe. 7736 ha. of the delta were declared a Natural Park in 1983. The economic activities carried out include agriculture (since the last century the delta has been dedicated to rice crops (20.000 ha.), fruits and vegetables), fisheries and aquaculture and tourism. 20% of the delta is a natural area, 75% a cropping area, and 5% an urban area (it hosts 50.000 people). Nowadays, there are important environmental problems, such as: the big hydro-electric dams that hinder the delta’s growth; coastal erosion larger than the sediment deposit resulting in a worrying coastal retreat; delta subsidence; a marine salt wedge;  invasive species; river water transfers; river flow decrease; water pollution, etc. The problems for which this initiative was developed are related to the delta retreat (i.e. the delta lighthouse is currently submerged) and climate change effects in an already vulnerable area. The geographical scale for implementation is the local level.									b) Objectives									The specific objectives of the project were (1) defining different potential climate scenarios for the Ebro Delta; (2) analysing the vulnerability at the ecological, economical and social levels; (3) defining the impacts and potential risks for the different components: coast, wetlands, dune systems, habitats, endangered species, health, agriculture, population and other socio-economic components; and (4) designing an action plan for climate change adaptation in each scenario. The timescale associated with implementation and goal achievement was 1 year (Dec. 2007-Dec. 2008)									6. Implementation of the ICZM Approach (i.e. management, tools, resources)									a) Project Management									The initiative was funded by the Department of Environment (Government of Catalonia) and managed and executed by the University of Cantabria. Therefore,  the level of entities involved is mainly regional.									b) ICZM tools									The study is a technical tool, a base for a regional coastal planning considering climate change effects. The specific tools applied were the following:									Among the different products there are included:																																Stocktaking of meteorological episodes, studies and projects													Analysis of the Evolution of climate variables and its effects													Integrated Vulnerability to climate change effects analysis, considering the physical, ecological, socioeconomic and administrative subsystems													Integrated Risk analysis on the economic, natural and social goods and services													Definition of a management plan, including adaptation and prevention measures regarding habitats and ecosystems.																															7. Cost and resources									The budget for the Diagnosis and Planning Phases of this initiative was €123.000. The manpower used for the implementation of the tool was approximately 6 people.									8. Effectiveness (i.e. were the foreseen goals/objectives of the work reached?)									The described objectives were achieved in the timescale defined. The realistic and specific image of the climate change effects on the area has allowed the creation of specific adaptation measures, including budget, timeframe, etc. 									9. Success and Fail factors									Factors that were helpful in achieving the objective were (1) the multidisciplinary technical group, (2) the multidisciplinary approach (3) all the information that was already collected and analysed by the previous work on climate change effects at the national scale.									Obstacles that was unhelpful in achieving the objectives were (1) the lack of long-term data on some crucial parameters which make areas such as the subsidence area so especially vulnerable, (2) some adaptation measures came into conflict with the social and political interests: i.e. coastal setbacks to permit a limited coastal retreating to achieve a new delta equilibrium mode was not supported by any local council representative as they were in close contact with and were representing those future affected neighbours; therefore, adaptation measures for the common benefit were at risk due to individual interests and ownerships, all of which generated conflicts.  									10. Unforeseen outcomes									A methodology to assess the climate change coastal effects in a highly vulnerable area, considering the local-specificity and based on a multidisciplinary technical work, which can be reproduced elsewhere. The adaptation measures for the common benefit were at risk due to political will and individual interests. 									11.

(UDELAR)  Alice Altesor FP6  Sustainability of land use in European regions is a central point of policy and management decisions at different levels of governance. Implementation of European policies designed to promote and protect multifunctional land use requires the urgent development of robust tools for the assessment of different scenarios'' impacts on the environmental and socio-economic sustainability. The technical objective of SENSOR is to build, validate and implement sustainability impact assessment tools (SIAT), including databases and spatial reference frameworks for the analysis of land and human resources in the context of agricultural, regional and environmental policies. The scientific challenge is to establish relationships between different environmental and socio-economic processes as characterised by indicators considered to be quantitative measures of sustainability. Scenario techniques will be used within an integrated modelling framework, reflecting various aspects of multifunctionality and their interactions. The focus will be on European sensitive regions, particularly those in accession countries, since accession poses significant questions for policy makers regarding the socio-economic and environmental effect of existing and proposed land use policies. SIAT will utilise the statistical and spatial data continuously collected by European and regional agencies. SENSOR will deliver novel solutions for integrated modelling, spatial and temporal scaling and aggregation of data, selection of indicators, database management, analysis and prediction of trends, education and implementation. SIAT will be made available to decision makers at the European and regional level, providing user-friendly interfaces and scientifically sound procedures for the assessment of environmental and monetary responses of policy options. Cost-benefit and cost-effectiveness analysis of policy implementation will be an integral part of the SIAT''s functions.

There is a need to protect existing flood prone areas, while managing flood plains to ensure a balance between social, economic and environmental considerations. Therefore the project’s requirement was to offer good practise examples for sustainable development and demonstrated practical low cost measures; including infrastructure for reducing flood damage to property and land, the results were widely disseminated. Results of Flows have clearly influenced flood management on the national level in all participating countries. They will be used for planning activities and for making future decision making on how to improve sustainability of development in fluvial areas at risk of flooding. Some of the project results will also be used to change or influence any legislation, shape future policies or planning guidance. For instance, in the Netherlands dissemination of the results will be a part of the Hanse passage network. Within the UK, spatial planners work to a government policy – Planning Policy Guidance for Development and Flood Risk. This policy was reviewed and the results of FLOWS helped to shape the new policy. FLOWS work also influenced the EU Flood Directive.

Experiences that can be exchanged									Thirty two EEA member countries are at different stages of preparing, developing and implementing national adaptation strategies. So far only ten have been produced. This case highlights the Finnish strategy which was the first to be completed, in 2005.									4. Overview of the case									The Adaptation Strategy gives a detailed account of the impacts of climate change in different sectors and presents measures to be taken until 2080. The main elements of the strategy are also included in the National Energy and Climate Strategy where the focus is on measures to be launched in the next 5 to 10 years. 									5. Context and Objectives									a) Context									Increase in greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere is leading to global warming and changes in the climate systems. The Finnish Meteorological Institute compiled climate change scenarios based on the existing international and national data. According to these estimates, in Finland by 2080, the average temperature could rise by 4-6°C and the average precipitation would grow by 15-25%. Extreme weather events, such as storms, droughts and heavy rains, are likely to increase. The Government Institute for Economic Research drew up a background study on the long-term scenarios for the economy and the Finnish Environment Institute examined the future development trends in natural conditions. 									The preparation of the Adaptation Strategy began in the latter half of 2003. Seminars were held in different sectors with a two-fold goal: to outline the projected impacts of climate change and adaptation, and to outline the involvement in, and views of, different stakeholders on the preparation work of the Adaptation Strategy. The work relied on existing research data, expert assessments and views. One of the research projects involved was the FINADAPT which is part of the Finnish Environmental Cluster Research Programme of the Ministry of the Environment and which is coordinated by the Finnish Environment Institute. The project assessed Finland’s adaptive capacity to climate change. The proposal for Finland’s National Strategy was presented at an open seminar in October 2004. The draft was sent to a number of stakeholders for comment and the general public was able to comment through the Internet. It was finalised in 2005. 									b) Objectives									The objective of the National Strategy for Adaptation to Climate Change is to strengthen and increase Finland’s adaptive capacity. This is to be achieved by: describing climate change and its impacts, as well as assessing the sensitivity of sectors; assessing current adaptive capacity, vulnerability and opportunities associated with climate change; and presenting actions that should be taken immediately and policies for future actions.									6. Implementation of the ICZM Approach (i.e. management, tools, resources)									a) Management									The work was coordinated by the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry and representatives from the Ministries of Traffic &amp; Communications, Trade &amp; Industry, Social Affairs &amp; Health, Environment, and Foreign Affairs as well as the Finnish Meteorological Institute and Finnish Environment Institute. Each Ministry was responsible for assessing the impacts and identifying adaptation measures in its own sector. The implementation of the Adaptation Strategy has been followed and promoted by a Coordination Group for Adaptation to Climate Change									b) ICZM tools									The strategy describes the impacts of climate change in the following sectors: agriculture &amp; food production, forestry, fisheries, reindeer husbandry, game management, water resources, biodiversity, industry, energy, traffic, land use and communities, building, health, tourism &amp; recreational use of nature, and insurance. It describes the present sensitivity to climate change and outlines actions and measures to improve the capacity and to adapt to future climate change. The strategy aims at reducing the negative consequences and taking advantage of the opportunities associated with climate change and includes a proposal on starting a research programme. The Strategy for Adaptation to Climate Change was drawn up as a self-standing and comprehensive work.									The Adaptation Strategy presents measures to be taken until 2080. The main elements of the strategy have been included in the National Energy and Climate Strategy where the focus is on measures to be launched in the next 5 to 10 years. Priorities identified for increasing adaptation capacities include: (i) mainstreaming climate change impacts and adaptation into sectoral policies, (ii) addressing long-term investments, (iii) coping with extreme weather events, (iv) improving observation systems, (v) strengthening the research and development base, and (vi) international cooperation. It was recommended that work on adaptation should be started immediately because in most cases this would also benefit the different sectors under present climatic conditions. In the Adaptation Strategy specific measures have been outlined for the 15 different sectors considered. In addition to these, some actions shared by different administrative sectors were also proposed. A preliminary, five level adaptation progress indicator was developed alongside the strategy and it is considered that Finland is currently at level 2. This means that among the decision-makers there is understanding of the impacts of climate change and the need for adaptation measures has been recognised. Some practical adaptation measures have already been identified and plans have been made, or even launched, for their implementation.									A Coordination Group for Adaptation to Climate Change was appointed to follow and promote the implementation of the strategy, with representatives of ministries, research institutes, research funding agencies and regional actors. The Coordination Group steered an evaluation of the implementation of the Adaptation Strategy conducted in 2008–2009. The Strategy will be reviewed in 2011–2013.									7. Cost and resources									The Climate Change Adaptation Research Programme is implementing the Adaptation Strategy by providing funding for research aimed to produce information in support of the planning of the practical adaptation measures. In 2006-08 the Ministries of Agriculture &amp; Forestry, Transport &amp; Communications and Environment funded 18 projects under the programme by ca. €500,000/year.									8. Effectiveness (i.e. were the foreseen goals/objectives of the work reached?)									The Adaptation Strategy does not contain an assessment of the effect of possible future mitigation measures on climate change. Instead, it focuses on some of the challenges that lie ahead up to 2080, assuming a range of plausible long-term scenarios of the climate and economic development and a description of the likely resulting effects on natural systems and processes. The most advanced sector in the implementation of the Adaptation Strategy has been the water resources management where adaptation to climate change is already well integrated into the decision-making. In the transport sector, community planning and agriculture and forestry the implementation of the Adaptation Strategy has also proceeded quite well although in most sectors the work is only in its early stages.									9. Success and Fail factors									The Climate Change Adaptation Research Programme has produced a lot of useful information in support of the adaptation measures but the resources available are smaller than were originally envisaged and this has not allowed comprehensive studies on all relevant sectors. 									10. Unforeseen outcomes									A challenge faced in the implementation of adaptation measures in practice is how to coordinate and distribute the responsibilities between the different administrative levels and the cooperation needed between the sectors.									11.

SUDPLAN from the end-users perspective
The end-users of the SUDPLAN services are city planners who can either work directly in the system or they can use different kinds of scientific users – IT, environmental modellers, statisticians etc – to support them. End-users will be able to evaluate risk hazards of storm water local runoff, river flooding and elevated air pollution levels for planned or existing urban areas subject to a changing climate.

SUDPLAN services will be demonstrated for four city pilots: Stockholm, Wuppertal, Linz and Prague. However, whatever European city may access the same Common Services as the pilots and they can also develop own local applications.


 The SUDPLAN project - Sustainable Urban Development Planner for Climate Change Adaptation - will develop a web-based planning, prediction and training tool to support decisions in long term urban planning. This will help to assure population´s health, comfort, safety and life quality as well as sustainability of investments in utilities and infrastructures within a changing climate. With it´s open nature and architectural design, SUDPLAN will contribute to a shared information space in Europe. Adaptation measures/responses

Even if hydropower, solar and wind energy, wood and other biomasses are richly distributed throughout the area, they are unequally accessible because of many territorial discrepancies. The need to balance an increasing production and use of RES (renewable energy sources) requires a stronger and more extended electric grid capable of dealing with high levels of remote power generation. Virtual Power Systems (VPS) offer an alternative by using ICT technology for an intelligent combination of load management, storage and demand. AlpEnergy focuses on both technical as well as economical aspects to introduce an efficient operational model that aims at a standardization of both technologies and procedures. It intends to provide new knowledge-based incomes and business opportunities to farmers, traditional and innovative enterprises, thus supporting the competitiveness of the Alpine ventures and making the Alpine space a showcase for other mountain areas in the world.

Application of the concepts to support routine asset management, which includes the regular inspection of dikes, will also be considered. Safer dikes are not only stronger but also smarter dikes.

 The UrbanFlood project will create an EWS framework that can be used to link sensors via the Internet to predictive models and emergency warning systems.  The data collected from the sensors will be interpreted to assess the condition and likelihood of failure; different models will be used to predict the failure mode and subsequent potential inundation in near real time. Through the Internet, additional computer resources required by the framework are made available on demand. Adaptive capacity

An important step towards such a co-ordinated approach is the development of an implementation plan where by jointly funded international projects can be supported. The development of such a plan is the first key goal of BASIN. 
The second goal of BASIN is to develop an integrated basin-scale North Atlantic research program, for submission to the EU 7th framework program, US NSF and Canadian NSERC for joint funding. Programmatic goals will be achieved in working groups including experts from both the EU and North America as well as delegates from funding organisations. 



 As a prerequisite for the development of the research proposal, this SSA will: 
(1) assess the status of climate related ecosystem research in the North Atlantic basin and associated shelf seas, 
(2) identify gaps in systematic observations and process understanding of atmospheric and oceanic parameters, 
(3) identify the potential for consolidation of long-term observations from EU and international databases for modelling and prediction.  Knowledge exchange International', 'Knowledge exchange', 'International', NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, 'MARINE;WATERMANAGEMENT;', 'VULNERABILITY;', NULL);

The water regime of the river is largely dependent on the operations of the Riga Hydropower plant. This is located some 30 km upstream from the mouth in the Riga Gulf, which itself impacts on water levels. Increased frequency and severity of flash floods is becoming an alarming problem for the city of Riga. They have caused widespread hazards to built-up areas, infrastructure and natural territories, including Natura 2000 areas. In 2008, Riga County Council (RCC) commissioned a hydro-dynamic modelling system to calculate flood risks and trends under different scenarios. The growing trend in floods is linked to climate change phenomena. In particular, storms are increasingly pushing water from the Riga Gulf into the River Daugava. To address both the floods and their causes according to the provisions of international, EU and national legislation in Latvia, there is a need for more integrated management planning. There is also greater need for awareness of the relevant issues amongst the general public, specialists from municipalities and politicians. 

The main objective of the project is to create the means necessary to ensure that hydrological processes intensified by climate change phenomena in Riga are adequately investigated and incorporated in the city’s planning system. This hopes to mitigate their current and future impact on Riga’s economy and society, nature and biodiversity, water resources and human health. The project plans to carry out detailed studies of the hydrological processes affecting Riga and their current and potential impacts. Workshops of specialists and local stakeholders will feed into these findings, leading to a report. The beneficiary will learn about best practices in identification, planning and management of flood risk zones in three European cities facing similar challenges: Rotterdam (the Netherlands); Antwerp (Belgium); and Hamburg (Germany). They will also share the results of the work in Riga. The project will define flood-protection priorities for each of six flood-risk zones around the city and for the city as a whole. Possible measures and activities will be evaluated, and their cost-effectiveness assessed. The work will lead to the agreement of a Flood Risk Management Plan for Riga City, which will recommend protection measures and also necessary changes in the city’s planning documents. Publicity and awareness-raising measures around flood risks and management will include a website, printed publications, events and media work. Specific targeted workshops will seek to feed stakeholder opinions into the project planning.', 'MEASURE', 'http://ec.europa.eu/environment/life/project/Projects/index.cfm?fuseaction=search.dspPage&n_proj_id=3413', 'URL', '', 'HydroClimateStrategyRiga - Integrated Strategy for Riga City to Adapt to the Hydrological Processes Intensified by Climate Change Phenomena LIFE08/ENV/LV/000451    MEASUREACTIONMEASURE', '', '', '', '', NULL, NULL, NULL, 'WATERMANAGEMENT;', 'MEASUREACTION;', '');

This proposal addresses scientific issues related to forestry and climate change. It is based on a 4 years coordinated joint programme of exchange of researchers for short periods (2 to 12 months), thus providing unique mobility possibilities to individual researchers and support to research organisations to establish and reinforce long-term research co-operation.

The proposal is focused on forests, forestry and climate change interactions, including assessment of impacts of climate change on forest ecosystem functioning and development of adaptation and mitigation strategies for forest management. The range of common tree species of interest and of climatic conditions, as well as the strategic importance of planted forests in the 5 partner countries involved, will provide a coherent framework and socio-economic background for the different research activities that will be conducted.  The added value of this project will be important given the quality and current level of collaborative activities between the partners involved. The added-value and gained knowledge will be mainly obtained from (1) intensive exchange of ideas, concepts and methodologies; (2) exchange of data and cross-validation of models ; (3) application and test of conceptual and generic models in contrasted situations; (4) comparative analysis of data and research results and joint synthesis and publications. 

It is expected that there will be a joint publication for each topic and partner, giving a total of 15 joint publications.

The future status of freshwater ecosystems is however, also dependent on changes in land-use, pollution loading and water demand. In addition the measures that need to be taken to restore freshwater ecosystems to good ecological health or to sustain priority species as required by EU Directives need to be designed either to adapt to future climate change or to mitigate the effects of climate change in the context of changing land-use. Generating the scientific understanding that enables such measures to be implemented successfully is the principal focus of REFRESH. 

The focus is on three principal climate-related and interacting pressures, increasing temperature, changes in water levels and flow regimes and excess nutrients, primarily with respect to lowland rivers, lakes and wetlands because these often pose the most difficult problems in meeting both the requirements of the WFD and Habitats Directive. 
REFRESH will advance our fundamental and applied science in 5 key areas: 
- Understanding how the functioning of freshwater ecosystems is affected by climate change 
- New indicators of functional response and tools for assessing vulnerability 
- Modelling ecological processes 
- Integrated modelling 
- Adaptive management. REFRESH is concerned with the development of a system that will enable water managers to design cost-effective restoration programmes for freshwater ecosystems at the local and catchment scales that account for the expected future impacts of climate change and land-use change in the context of the WFD and Habitats Directive. At its centre is a process-based evaluation of the specific adaptive measures that might be taken to minimise the consequences of climate change on freshwater quantity, quality and biodiversity.

Overview of the case									This case describes the steps taken towards achieving more balanced management of a multi-use harbour: Cork Harbour, Ireland. It includes the integration of risk associated with climate change, through the establishment of a strategic alliance (couplet) between the local authority and multidisciplinary academic experts. This innovative relationship resulted in the adaptation of an Integrated Harbour Management Strategy set up with the consensus of stakeholders, and a strengthening link between science and policy at the local level.									5. Context and Objectives									a) Context									Cork Harbour is a large natural harbour on the southern coast of Ireland. It is of considerable importance to the socio-economic well being of County Cork and the surrounding region. It is the second largest port in Ireland, is a hub for global pharmaceutical and food-processing industries and has also a long tradition of recreation use, including sailing, fishing and power boating. All of these activities are of vital importance to the society and economy of Cork and surrounding region but also for the national economy. The Harbour is designated as both a Special Protection Area for birds and a Ramsar Wetland Site of International Importance. The areas of salt marsh habitats and intertidal mudflats are also designated as a Special Area of Conservation.									There was a recognised need for balancing the development and conservation needs of different stakeholders in this multiple use  harbour due to the potential for tension and conflicts of interests between users. The most important issues arising were the impact of industries and land use activities (in Brownfield sites, water quality, atmospheric pollution); catchments land use (urbanisation and infrastructure development, land use changes); Maritime Spatial Planning (port development, aquaculture &amp; fisheries, maritime transport); Maritime heritage, recreation and tourism (carrying capacity); and coastal flooding and erosion (impacts of climate change). The implementation of the ECN approach was at a local scale with comprehensive regulatory body involvement.									The local authorities are the principal planning consent bodies and have a significant influence on physical developments related to the marine leisure sector in Ireland, although other statutory bodies have a planning remit in the coastal environment. 									b) Objectives									The main objective of the approach was to move towards the establishment of an ICZM framework strategy for the Harbour and a better integration of science-based knowledge in the planning and management regime, strengthening the link between science and policy. This was to be done with stakeholder participation and consensus. These goals were to be achieved in a mid-term timescale (3-5 years).									6. Implementation of the ICZM Approach (i.e. management, tools, resources)									a) Management									The main bodies involved were Cork County Council (local planning authority), particularly the Planning Department and the Coastal and Marine Resources Centre (CMRC), a multi-disciplinary research group from University College Cork. CMRC was responsible for conducting the associated studies and to provide scientific-based knowledge into the managing context. The Council, as the local authority, were responsible for the decision-making process and action.									b) ICZM tools									A strategic alliance between the local authority and academic experts was established with direct interaction on a regular basis. Discussions included, planning, technical measures and research tools. New knowledge of physical, social and economical attributes of Cork Harbour was generated through various studies that were mutually agreed. These involved a multidisciplinary approach, with collaborative input of geographers, engineers, environmental scientists, geo-morphologists, legal experts and GIS IT specialists. Recommendations were made and discussed with planners who added value to the research process by contributing their local knowledge, professional experience and appreciation of political realities to the equation. The ultimate outcome was the publication of an Integrated Management Strategy for Cork Harbour in 2008. There was stakeholder consensus by means of a multi-stakeholder Forum underpinned by the couplet relationship. 									7. Cost and resources									Initial work was funded through the INTERREG IIIB COREPOINT project and will continue to the implementation phase under the INTERREG IVB IMCORE project 									8. Effectiveness (i.e. were the foreseen goals/objectives of the work reached?)									Most of the initial objectives were achieved in the timescale defined. These included, or were reflected in, a broader understanding of ICZM in practice, increased awareness of management options for specific problems (such as recreational carrying capacity) and an enhanced relationship between research group and the local authority. More specific objectives included those associated with the needs of the Planning Department, such as studies of the potential of coastal Brown field sites within the Harbour, the recreational carrying capacity of the Harbour and a landscape character assessment of the coastal zone. Overall, the couplet approach helped to initiate and consolidate a shift in attitude and behaviour towards traditional science and management practices in situations where new relationships between researchers and practitioners were formed.									9. Success and Fail factors									The interaction between the academic and local authority staff was favoured by their physical proximity. Both were motivated by the success of previous ICZM approaches. On the other hand, staff turnover in both the local authority and the research centre delayed the process. Lack of time availability and a limited local authority remit for the marine environment together with conflict of interests negatively affected the progress of the process.									Lack of adequate finances has been a continuous negative factor in the couplet relationship.									10. Unforeseen outcomes									Many positive outcomes can be identified: better understanding and trust developed between coastal research and practice communities at local levels, realisation of mutual benefits, build professional capital to help address future challenges, harness relevant and appropriate science for decision-making, deliver local level ICZM and bridge the gap between EC Recommendation and local level implementation of ICZM. Even if the ECN is not permanent, the link between these two universes will be easily re-established. However, this ECN failed to incorporate the principle of complexity in the Sustainability framework and the precautionary principle was also disregarded. Some trans-boundary aspects were considered too ethereal and unrelated to more immediate, predefined management issues and processes.									11.

Overview of the case									The Strategy is, together with the National Stocktaking of Actors Laws and Institutions, the response of Spain to the European Commission Recommendation 413/2002/CE on the implementation of ICZM in Europe. It is based on the principles of sustainable development and integrated management, and is organized in ten specific objectives to be fulfilled through the following instruments: Master Plan for Coastal Sustainability, Observatory for Coastal Sustainability, Institutional agreements, National Coastal Council, Land acquisition, Research &amp; Development, Education and Training, Capacity Building.									5. Context and Objectives									a) Context									The geographical scopes of this initiative are the Mediterranean and South Atlantic coast of Spain including the Canary and Balearic Islands. The Spanish coast has high ecological and landscape values. Nowadays, 32% of total population is living in coastal areas with the consequently enormous pressure of the different socio-economic activities. Besides that, competences on the coastal zone are shared between different sectoral administrations at the national, regional and local level. The problems and issues, for which this Strategy has been developed, are related to massive, unplanned and unsustainable development of the coastal zone, deterioration of coastal ecosystems, coastal erosion, climate change effects, lack of technical knowledge about the coastal zones, unco-ordinated decision-making, and lack of public participation in the decision-making. This initiative has been implemented at the national scale. Other relevant aspects to be considered are that coastal management is characterised by overlapping of competences among the different administrations and lack of administrative coordination, integrated information and public involvement.									b) Objectives									The specific objectives to be achieved with the ICZM approach were: (1) sustainable management of the interaction between natural physical processes and human occupation of coastal zones, including urbanism and land planning tools; (2) protection and recovery of coastal ecosystems, (3) optimisation of natural resources respecting the carrying capacity of the coastal system; (4) safety when encountering environmental risks (natural hazards and human mistakes); (5) improvement of resources for the public use and access to the coast, following sustainable criteria; (6) recovery and promotion of coastal cultural heritage; (7) decision-making based on integrated information and knowledge about the coastal system; (8) coordination between the different administrative levels and sectors to enforce the coherence and the territorial cohesion; (9) transparency of the management process and public participation in the planning process; and (10) financial consolidation to assure the availability of technical and economic resources.									Other relevant issues being considered were: broad overall perspective, knowledge based approach, local specificity, working with natural processes.									The timescale associated with implementation and goals achievement was 8 years, divided in the following phases: Diagnosis (2002-2005), Planning (2006-2007), Implementation and monitoring (2008-2010)									6. Implementation of the ICZM Approach (i.e. management, tools, resources)									a) Project Management									The authority promoting the initiative is the Spanish Ministry of Environment, General Directorate for the Coast (DGC). All the DGC Regional departments have been involved. National, regional and local entities have been involved.									b) ICZM tools									The category of this ICZM initiative is a planning, technical tool. The specific tools applied are: Integrated coastal diagnosis and an integrated management plan including several measures like coastal protection, control of coastal erosion through nourishment, Public Domain and Influence Zone management, cultural heritage recovery, accessibility and common use of the coastal zone. Institutional meetings between the Ministry of Environment and the Regional Governments have been held in order to sign institutional agreements to ensure vertical integration: 6 out of 10 agreements have been signed.									7. Cost and resources									The budget for the Diagnosis and Planning Phases of this initiative was €6,000,000. The manpower used for the implementation of the tool was approximately 100 people.									8. Effectiveness (i.e. were the foreseen goals/objectives of the work reached?)									The ten specific objectives are to be fulfilled through the previously defined instruments, which have different levels of fulfilment: 																																Completely developed: Master Plan for Coastal Sustainability (obj. 1- 6)													Initiated: Institutional agreements, Land acquisition, Research &amp; Development, Education and Training (obj. 1- 10)													Planned: Observatory for Coastal Sustainability, National Coastal Council (1-10)																															Therefore, the objectives associated to the Diagnosis and Planning phases have been successfully completed and in the timescale defined. 									9. Success and Fail factors									The Institutional agreements signed between the Ministry of Environment and the different coastal regions (Autonomous Communities) to ensure co-operation can be mentioned amongst the main factors that were helpful in achieving the objective. Also the presence of coastal legislation, coastal administration, and European legislation pushing ICZM forward. 									Regarding the aspects and circumstances that hindered the achievement of goals, changes in Government (included the Ministry of Environment), translated into political willingness, have delayed the implementation phase of the plan. Also, the overlapping of competences in coastal management, as the proposed planning measures can cover only the competences of the Ministry of Environment.									10. Unforeseen outcomes									Through the integrated diagnosis of the coastal zone developed, Spanish society is more aware of the human impacts on the Spanish coast and is starting to demand a more sustainable coastal management.

Thus, a major aim of global change research is the development of reliable predictions on future geographic distributions of species, communities and functional diversity. These predictions allow to assess the impacts of climatic changes on ecosystem goods and services, to develop adaptive management and conservation strategies and to demonstrate the magnitude of the problem to decision makers. However, the reliability of recent model-based assessments for future species'' range dynamics suffers from the fact that most macro-ecological modeling approaches lack in ecological mechanisms and evolutionary dynamics. 

The present project seeks to improve the quality and reliability of species distribution models by bridging the gap between macro-ecological approaches and the accumulating evidence of the importance of evolutionary dynamics for species'' response to climate change. 
In particular, we will 
(i) evaluate the potential of rapid adaptive evolution for a set of 50 alpine plant species using a novel Bayesian approach to population-based phylo-genetics
(ii) develop a software module ''xEvol'' that incorporates evolutionary dynamics into the existent species distribution model BIOMOVE, and 
(iii) simulate and evaluate the species'' range dynamics for an ensemble of IPCC AR4 climate change scenarios.

Overview of the case									A network of partners are promoting the use of Green and Blue infrastructure as a means to adapt to predicted levels of climate change. All the partners are bringing in their ideas so that measures can be incorporated in the planning process. Such an approach is needed by all community agglomerations however large or small, coastal or otherwise.									5. Context and Objectives									a) Context									Climate change is the greatest emerging humanitarian challenge of our time. It is causing 300,000 deaths a year and is affecting the lives of 325 million people, according to a report produced by the United Nation’s think-tank, the Global Humanitarian Forum. The UN Climate Change Conference in Bali, in 2007, saw the adoption of the Bali Action Plan which placed significant importance on climate change adaptation. This was identified ‘as one of the five key building blocks required (shared vision, mitigation, adaptation, technology and financial resources) for a strengthened future response to climate change to enable the full, effective and sustained implementation of the Convention through long-term co-operative action, now, up to and beyond 2012’.									At the European level, the European Commission (EC) recently published a White Paper, Adapting to Climate Change: Towards a European Framework for Action. The White Paper identifies the EU’s vulnerability to the impact of climate change and sets out why an adaptation strategy is needed at an EU level. It looks at the impact of climate change on a number of sectors, including: 																																Human health and well-being: As Europe experiences more extreme climate events, weather-related deaths and diseases could increase.													Water: The quality and availability of water resources is a fundamental concern raised by a changing climate. Parts of Europe already experience high levels of water stress, with consequences not just for human health but also for food production.													Agriculture: Climate change will potentially impact on crop yields, livestock management and the location of production. Soil fertility will be affected by the depletion of organic matter resulting from climate change. Forests are also likely to be affected in terms of productivity and the geographic range of tree species. There will also be additional pressure on fisheries and aquaculture, with potentially severe impacts on coasts and marine ecosystems.													Energy: Climate change will have a direct effect on both the supply of, and demand for, energy. Increasing summer temperatures will add to the demand for cooling, and the impacts of extreme weather events may affect electricity distribution.													Infrastructure: Extreme climatic events have significant economic and social impacts, especially where infrastructure is damaged - for example domestic and commercial buildings, transport, and energy and water supply.																															b) Objectives									The network facilitates the much needed exchange of knowledge and experience and the actual transfer of good practice on climate change adaptation strategies to local and regional authorities. 									6. Implementation of the ICZM Approach (i.e. management, tools, resources)									a) Management									The Town and Country Planning Association (UK) is an independent charity working to improve the art and science of town and country planning, inspiring government, industry and campaigns to take a fresh perspective on major issues. It is leading fourteen organisations, drawn from eight European countries, representing a broad spectrum of authorities and climate change challenges, all with varying degrees of strategic policy and experience, which are networking with each other to integrate climate change adaptation into regional planning and development.									b) ICZM tools									Regional and local spatial planning and urban design can provide solutions that will make our communities less vulnerable to climate change risks. Green infrastructure such as gardens, parks, productive landscapes, green corridors, and green roofs and walls, and blue infrastructure such as water bodies, rivers, streams, floodplains and sustainable drainage systems, play a vital role in creating climate-resilient development. However, this role is not sufficiently recognised at present and is consequently inadequately integrated into mainstream planning. There is also a strong business case for climate change adaptation. Adaptive measures are essential to help manage global economic losses due to climate change, currently amounting to more than US $125 billion per year and predicted to rise to US $340 billion annually by 2030. Adaptation technologies also provide an economic opportunity for ‘green growth’. 									Much green infrastructure – such as parks, for example – is multi-functional. Parks are important not only for climate change adaptation, but also for health and well-being – a park acts as a reservoir for storm water, a shelter from the sun, and a place in which to take exercise. In England, however, public parks and green spaces are chronically under-valued. A combination of historic cost accounting and depreciation causes most councils there to assign their public parks a notional asset value of just £1 each, making them financially invisible and leading to repeated under-investment. In reality, a single park’s physical assets – excluding land value – can have a value well over £100 million and can offer huge environmental benefits. In a changing climate, the role of parks has never been more important. In seeking to deal with the challenge of climate change, the demands on planning and urban design have never been greater. New developments must be designed to cope with future rather than historical climates. Adaptation of the urban environment can be implemented through design and development at a variety of different spatial scales:																																Conurbation; solar control including shading, orientation and building morphology; evaporative cooling; ground water cooling; open water use and green infrastructure.													Neighbourhood; increasing ventilation, cool or reflective building materials on roofs and facades, cool pavement materials.													individual building; building envelope insulation, active or mechanical cooling, thermal storage or mass.													the menu of strategies for managing high temperatures includes groundwater cooling using aquifers at a conurbation scale; increased ventilation through orientation and urban morphology at the neighbourhood scale; and active or mechanical cooling at a building scale.																															7.

Setting the objectives and the targets of erosion management schemes is not an easy or a straight-forward task. A clear, systematic and efficient methodology, adapted to local conditions, is a necessary tool.									4. Overview of the case									Social perception was assessed in a pilot study, through a well documented process, based on field surveys. 									5. Context and Objectives									a) Context									The pilot site, Dolos-Kiti, is a coastal area located in Larnaka District, with a 36 km coastline. There are 10 villages in this coastal area, with a total population of 9,173 and several conflicting uses like industry, tourism, agriculture and aquaculture. The coast is, in general, relatively low and flat, and it is mainly characterised by accumulations of gravel and pebble and few tiny, poor sandy beaches. The area suffers from severe erosion which in some areas reaches about 0,5 m/year. The land uses of the coastal area have been mainly agricultural until recently, when, by a reform of the Town Planning regime, most of the agricultural areas have been characterised as tourist or development areas. This led to a sudden increase of pressure for tourism and real estate development. Eventually the problem of beach quality became very important in the area and efforts started to combat erosion, with the construction of coastal structures either through the legal process or illegally.									b) Objectives									One of the main objectives of this study was to assess social perception on erosion management in order to have a tool for decision makers and for planning an awareness raising campaign.									6. Implementation of the ICZM Approach (i.e. management, tools, resources)									a) Management									Coastal Engineer X.I. Loizidou, ISOTECH ltd, was the project manager of the Dolos-Kiti pilot study (coordinator and scientific responsible).									b) ICZM tools									The methodology followed for assessing social perception included a static analysis and a dynamic analysis. The static analysis included the bibliographic work, the collection and evaluation of data and information on physical, socio-economic, administrative and legal characteristics of the area. The dynamic analysis included two kind of field surveys, (i) The beach users survey and (ii) the stakeholders survey. For the beach users’ surveys, 200 interviews on the beach have been carried out. Four main criteria were implemented for the selection of five survey beaches along the 36 km coastline of the coastal area:																																Living beaches known to users, mainly used by locals, who have knowledge of the beach evolution through-out the years													The coastline has been, or still is, under erosion													The beach is used for amenity reasons													Hard coastal structures have been constructed in the specific area. For the stakeholders survey, this included 20 in-depth, face to face interviews with persons that have been identified as representatives of the three major stakeholders groups:													Politicians and officers (e.g. representatives from the Local Authorities of the villages, from the District officer of Larnaca, from the Cyprus Tourist Organisation)													Experts involved in projects related to the area (e.g. Coastal Engineer, Marine Biologist, Environmental Engineer)													Economic - Social group (e.g. Members of the Board of the Fishermen Association, from industrial and commercial activities hosted in the area, from NGOs)																															7. Cost and resources									The cost of the study was €20,000.									8. Effectiveness (i.e. were the foreseen goals/objectives of the work reached?)									The “static analysis” coupled with the “dynamic data” from the results of the surveys proved to be an efficient methodology to assess positive and negative results of coastal erosion management schemes from the perspective of local society, as well as to evaluate their anticipated impact on social and economic assets. These assessments form an important decision making and policy tool.									9. Success and Fail factors									An important factor that contributed to the success of the Cypriot pilot study was the availability of data. Plenty of data existed concerning the physical, administrational and social environment of the area. However, these data have been stored in several Departments and offices and a lot of work was needed to collect and evaluate them. 									10. Unforeseen outcomes									According to the results of the beach-users survey, people like hard engineering structures for combating erosion, such as breakwaters.  This was an unforeseen result, which needed further evaluation, since it could mis-lead decision makers. By a more detailed evaluation in the characteristics of the surveys sites and the relevant questions, it was evident that beach users were put in front of the dilemma “either breakwaters or beach erosion”.  They were not given any other alternative. Thus their answer was this specific one. Social perception is based mainly on comparisons and experiences: what people knew in the past and what they see now, what they’ve seen in other areas and what they would like to have. So, the answers should be evaluated within the context and the local conditions. This was an important outcome.									The results of the study are still in use by experts and the public in Cyprus. It has been presented in conferences and local workshops. The systematic presentation of the physical, administrative and environmental data for the area has been appreciated in Cyprus, as well as the conclusions and remarks that resulted from the surveys. 									11.

Overview of the case									The coastal barrier between the Adriatic Sea and the lagoon is constituted by the littorals of Jesolo, Cavallino, Lido, Pellestrina, Sottomarina and Isola Verde. The lagoon communicates with the sea through the three inlets of Lido, Malamocco and Chioggia. Over time, the coastal strip has lost its defensive function. The built-up areas closest to the sea are ever more often at risk.These problems have been faced through a complex programme of interventions, including the reinforcement of the coastline. The measures adopted have been developed from international experienced reshaped for the particular coastline.									5. Context and Objectives									a) Context									Venice is located in a lagoon protected from the Adriatic Sea by a coastal barrier that stretches for a total of about 60 km.  The coastline is made up of strips of land: the coastal strips of Jesolo and Cavallino, the two inlands of Lido and Pellestrina and the sand beaches of Sottomarina and Isola Verde. The lagoon is in contact with the sea through the three inlets of Lido, Malamocco and Chioggia. For centuries, the entire coastline was subject to erosion, putting the historical urban centres and lagoon settlements at risk of erosion and flooding. Over time, the coastal strip has lost its resilience. The causes of the erosion of the coastline are many: lack of river sediment transport, natural phenomena such as eustasy as well as subsidence, wave destructive forces. To reinforce the coastal strip, in the 18th century strong sea wall defences, called &quot;murazzi&quot;, were built causing a lack of resilience to the system apart from only incomplete protection being afforded with the breaking during the 4 November 1966 storm surge. 									In recent times this strip of beach has undergone much erosion and has been reduced, and the dune area has almost disappeared due also to the tourist pressures. After the dramatic flood of 1966, the need to reinforce the coastlines becomes more and more urgent. From 1995, these problems have been tackled through a specific programme of interventions including the reinforcement of the coastline.									b) Objectives									The measures adopted aim at defending the Venice littoral affected by erosion, protecting the lagoon and inhabited areas near to the sea from sea storms. In addition, the programme enhances landscape with environment improvement, through the reconstruction of protected beaches and dune strips, supporting also the intense tourist use of that area. 									6. Implementation of the ICZM Approach (i.e. management, tools, resources)									a) Management									After the dramatic flood of 1966, an exceptional body of legislation, including both ordinary and special laws, was created. The safeguarding of the Venice lagoon has been defined as a matter of &quot;pre-eminent national interest&quot; and it is constituted by a complex system which links the physical protection to the restoration of environmental balance and socio-economic development as a whole. The laws addressed the threat that high waters, sea storms, erosion, pollution, socio-economic changes, fragile urban structures impose on the well-being of the lagoon and its populated areas. Those activities of safeguarding Venice and the lagoon ecosystem have been delegated by the Special Law to the State and are implemented by the Ministry for Infrastructure and Transport - Venice Water Authority, through the Consorzio Venezia Nuova. Therefore, the Consorzio Venezia Nuova on behalf of the Ministry of Infrastructure - Venice Water Authority has been implementing an extensive system of measures throughout the Venice lagoon area, including the project for the coast reinforcement of the littoral. The interventions have been carried out in agreement with regional and municipal authorities with the supervision of an international Committee. 									b) ICZM tools									The coastal defence measures consist of beach nourishments which are protected by groynes and submerged breakwater together with the restoration of the dune area. These measures were designed primarily as defence structures against sea storms. Nevertheless, the newly protected beaches and the dunes restoration programme have contributed to restore typical elements favouring habitat  for protected species. A series of studies and experiments have been carried out in order to develop advanced techniques to reinforce and reconstruct extensive sections of the Venice coastline. 									The first step was to analyse the local conditions such as wave motion, currents, sand volume, sediment transport, dunes and coastal vegetation. The studies provided the evolution of the coastline. 									The second step consisted in identifying the at-risk zones, with the aim to identify the most suitable strategies to adopt in order to minimise erosion and flood damage in case of extreme events. From 1995, the work has involved 7 stretches of littoral with a total of 60 km of coastline and about 9.2 million m3 of sand used for the creation of new beaches and the widening of the existing ones. In addition, 8 km of dunes have been reconstructed. The total volume of sand has been dredged from an area at sea after a preliminary investigation, and mitigation/compensation activity. To go into more details, the following 7 works have been realized:					                						Littoral Areas	Period	M3 of sand	Type of works	Isola Verde	1998-2002	450,000	Beach nourishment of 2 km of littoral and the construction of 7 groynes in rocks	Sottomarina	1998-2000	100,000	Construction of a breakwater wall and the beach nourishment of 500m of littoral	Pellestrina	1995-1999	4,100,000	Creation of a new wide beach extending for more than 9 km. The new beach is protected by 18 containment groynes, connected by a submerged (-1.5 m) breakwater parallel to the coast. The submerged breakwater is 300 m from the shore and runs along the full 9 km of the coastline.	Lido	2004 - on going	0	Construction of a submerged (-1m) breakwater 60m wide, 300 m from the shore and running along 4,700 m of the coastline, with 4 new groynes connected to the submerged breakwater. 	Cavallino	1995- 1997	4,100,000	- Beach nourishment widening 11 km of beach. The new beach has been protected with 31 transverse rock groynes designed with the most appropriate spacing, substituting the 65  previously existing.- Restoration of the ancient dune belt for a total of 5 km and transplantation of 800.000 specimens of Ammophila littoralis. Dune systems play an important role in protecting the hinterland from flooding caused by sea storms and mitigating wind action. The measures also have considerable value in terms of the landscape and environment improvement.	Jesolo	1999-2003	570,000	- Beach nourishment for 10 km of littoral, and the realization of a wide flight of steps (+2,50m) for beach access.- The restoration of dune environment close to the mouth of the Piave River and  the reinforcement of the breakwaters close to the mouth of the Sile River around the light.	Cortellazo	1999-2003	351,000	The works consists of the construction of 6 groynes and the beach nourishment.	Eraclea	2003-2004	300,000	Concerning the littoral of Eraclea, the works consists of  the prolongation of 9 groynes and beach nourishment within the 8 cell.                    									7. Cost and resources									€300,000 million 									8. Effectiveness (i.e. were the foreseen goals/objectives of the work reached?)									The works have achieved the objective to reinforce and defend the littoral of Venice for every extreme event with a return period of less than 350 years (such as a storm surge of Hs=4 m at sea with a 2 m a.sl.). Now the coast is able to sustain high energy storm events. The measures adopted are characterised by a high degree of adaptive capacity and resilience in order to respond to the uncertainties of climate change. 12  years after the completion of the works, monitoring shows that the interventions have been able to protect the inhabited areas against beach erosion and storm damages with a refilling need of less than 10%. 									9. Success and Fail factors									Local authority agreements between State, regional and municipal authorities have been a successful element for the whole programme, allowing synergies between different interventions and tourist use of the littoral from April till September. The local population was very much in favour of the protection also for its integration with the flood barrier installation. In some cases, such as Pellestrina, disturbances were caused wind driven sand which was solved with the use of Tamarix gallica. The new colour of the sand was also a problem solved with the extra cost of excavating a trench and covering the new sand with the local one. 									10. Unforeseen outcomes									The submerged breakwaters have increased local biodiversity with more than 180 species of fishes, microalgae and zoobenthos. In some cases, the creation of a new beach or the widening of the existing ones caused a problem related to wind driven sand  but also the development of new dune fields.									11.

It aims to share the experience of a great part of the MEDOCC territory: Spain (València, Catalunya, Murcia and Illes Balears), Italy (Sardegna and Sicilia), France (Alps-Provence-Côte d’Azur), Greece (Crete), and Tunisia.
Therefore, the project includes four of the most extensive West Mediterranean islands (Sicilia, Sardegna, Crete and Balears), often known as “hot spots” of biodiversity. On these islands, evolutive characteristics of the flora have caused the appearance of a great number of high biological value endemisms. These islands are strongly dependent on tourism, which has not always been respectful ot their natural inheritance.




 Faced with this general concern regarding biodiversity degradation, the European project GENMEDOC recognises and defends the need to adopt, throughout the basin, shared guidelines for the management and conservation of genetic material proceeding from the Mediterranean flora.
The GENMEDOC project, co-financed by the European Union, brings together the initiatives dealing with the conservation and valuation of our biodiversity, one of Europe’s environmental priorities and, at the same time, one of the prioritized pivots of the communitarian programme INTERREG IIIB MEDOCC, which supports transnational cooperation projects in the domain of territorial development of western Mediterranean countries.
The valuation, protection and management of our natural inheritance lies at the core of this pivot, which includes the development of European ecological networks (support to NATURA 2000).

Together, these processes pose an urgent challenge to conservation science, requiring ever increasing efficiency in ecologically-based decision making, to slow down, and hopefully eventually reverse, the ongoing global loss of biodiversity. In responding to this challenge, I am proposing a project in which the over-arching goal is to provide improved conservation-oriented analytical methods and tools to underpin knowledge-based land-use planning and associated political decision making. 
The proposed work builds on a broad established history of research in the field of spatial ecology and conservation prioritization. 
 Specific components of the proposal include: (i) developing the general conceptual, ecological, methodological and statistical basis of environmental and conservation resource allocation: (ii) combining species and community-level prioritization approaches for data-poor areas of the world; (iii) developing methods for alleviating the negative ecological consequences of climate change, based on connectivity both in geographic and environmental space; (iv) developing an uncertainty-analytic method for the planning of habitat restoration and calculation of compensation ratios for habitat that will be impacted due to economic activity, (v) developing methods for allocating alternative conservation actions (protection, maintenance, restoration) in combination with habitat-specific loss rates in spatial conservation prioritization, and (vi) implementing the proposed methods as publicly available, efficient and well-documented software packages.

This method will be based on combining a well-established sensitive paleo-climate proxy with a recent discovery: the stable carbon isotopic composition (´13C) of marine dinoflagellates (algae) and their organic fossils (dinocysts) reflects seawater carbonate chemistry, particularly pCO2. 
 The research will shed new light on processes such as ocean acidification and the marine carbon cycle as a whole. Past analogues of rapid carbon injection can aid in the quantification of climate change and identification of vulnerable biological groups, critical to identify tipping points in system Earth. The study of dinoflagellate carbon isotopes comprises the initiation of a new research field and will provide constraints on ocean acidification in the past and its consequences in the future.

Within three years, they will share their experiences, and create concrete tools supporting not only the alpine lakes stakeholders, but also the young and general public, by educational tools.  SILMAS, by exchanging good practices and testing new methods, will supply its 15 partners with efficient tools for reaching goals of the frame directives (Water and Natura 2000) and the Alpine Convention: 
* creation of a virtual laboratory, to define current ecological state of the lakes and anticipate changes due to climatic and biological dynamics,
* assessment of existing governance tools dealing with regulation of land/resources and conflicts solving, then testing decision-making instruments in different lakes sites,

- How does the simulated haze-cloud continuum compare with remote sensing measurements and what is the consequence of abandoning the traditional and artificial distinction between aerosols and clouds?
 - How are cloud and precipitation formation influenced by atmospheric chemical composition changes? 
- To what extent do haze and cloud formation in polluted air exert forcings of synoptic meteorological conditions and climate? 
- Can aerosol pollution in the Mediterranean region exacerbate the predicted and observed drying in a changing climate? 

 We have developed a new numerical method to consistently compute atmospheric trace gas and aerosol chemistry and cloud processes. The method is computationally efficient so that it can be used in climate models. For the first time cloud droplet formation on multi-component particles can be represented based on first principles rather than parameterisations. This allows for a direct coupling in models between aerosol chemical composition and the continuum between hazes and clouds as a function of ambient relative humidity. We will apply the method in a new nested global-limited area model system to study atmospheric chemistry climate interactions and anthropogenic influences. We will focus on the Mediterranean region because it is a hot spot in climate change exposed to drying and air pollution. The limited area model will also be applied as cloud-resolving model to study aerosol influences on precipitation and storm development. By simulating realistic meteorological conditions at high spatial resolution our method can be straightforwardly tested against observations.

The Project will identify all adaptation strategies that were developed in Europe and also globally for handling (preventing, eliminating, combating, mitigating) the impacts of global climate changes on water resources and aquatic ecosystems, including all other water related issues of the society and nature.
Research needs in the field of ''climate impact on the water cycle and water users'' will be identified with special regard to enable the ranking of adaptation action in the light of the magnitude of impact on water resources and the urgency of the action needed.  The most important output of the project will be the identification of gaps that would hinder the implementation of the EU water policy in combating climate impacts on water. The project will formulate a coherent framework on adaptation strategies of climate change impacts on water resources, water cycling and water uses of the society and nature with special regard to those that water policy has to take into account when considering climate change impacts.

Overview of the case									Malmö is using blue and green infrastructure e.g. roof gardens and innovative surface water systems to meet the needs of neighbourhood communities faced with the challenges of future climate effects. It is already planning for the future and involving the residents in formulated solutions.									5. Context and Objectives									a) Context									The City of Malmö is the third largest city in Sweden, and is committed to environmental and social goals. Augustenborg, once a rundown 1950s/60s neighbourhood, has been re-developed and re-energised as part of a very successful and far-reaching project called EcoCity Augustenborg. It is now an excellent example of an ecologically, socially and economically sustainable quarter, with climate change adaptation playing a key role. Situated on top of several industrial and office buildings in the area is the Green Roof Institute, where the world''s first botanical roof garden was constructed in Malmö back in 1999, and now provides a valuable resource for research and education. Green and blue spaces have been incorporated into the regeneration plans to address issues such as flooding (with extensive community participation), including retro-fitting the area with innovative new surface water systems, green roofs, gardens, recreation areas, and renovated courtyards. The Western Harbour, an old industrial estate, has also been transformed into a leading example of environmental city-living by means of collaborative, high quality, urban design. The Bo-01 district is supplied by 100 per cent locally generated renewable energy and offers public transport and cycling facilities as well as generous use of space for green and blue infrastructure with a strong  focus on social sustainability.									b) Objectives									The EcoCity is working within the residential area of Augustenborg in Malmö, as well as with the school, industrial area and other local businesses to bring climate change adaptation measures into urban planning at an early stage. Another key aim of the project is to enable residents to take a leading role in the ideas, design and implementation of the project.									6. Implementation of the ICZM Approach (i.e. management, tools, resources)									a) Management									The Sustainable Development Unit at the City of Malmö is responsible for this work.									b) ICZM tools					                					Storm water and green roofs:The storm water system has gone through a major change. Green roofs and open storm water channels leading into ponds have stopped the flooding in the area and have created a more amenable environment and a richer biodiversity. The MKB housing company has built houses which have 2,100 m2 green roofs whilst the Botanical Roof Garden covers 9,000 m2, one of the few green roofs in the world that is accessible and open to the public! This green roof is a living surface of plants growing in a soil layer on top of the roof. The soil layer (or another substrate than soil can be used) was spread over the roof membrane itself, with a protective root barrier, and a drainage layer underneath. On the substrate, draught-tolerant species of plants are grown, usually Sedum spp.. This forms an attractive mat that flowers and changes its appearance with the seasons. Roof vegetation like this one does not damage the waterproofing membrane of the roof, in fact it even protects it from the uv-light which does damage the membrane over time.                    					                					Blue infrastructure:There are a total of 6 km of canals and water channels in Augustenborg. 90% of the storm water from roofs and hard surfaces is led into the open storm-water system in the housing area. The aim the project was that 70% of all storm water should be taken care of for the whole of Augustenborg.                    					                					Energy:Ideas from residents are behind the large solar energy project in Augustenborg with 450 m2 solar panels in the industrial area connected to the central heating system and solar panels on the new school building and a number of demonstration photovoltaic systems in the industrial area. The Augustenborg solar project was the starting point for Solar City Malmö which operates all over Malmö. In spring 2009, a wind power plant was installed at the local school.                    					                					Waste collection:Today there are 15 recycling facilities handling full recycling and composting for the 1800 inhabitants of Augustenborg. The aim is that 90% of the waste from Augustenborg will be collected and recycled, re-used etc.  The venues were based on design ideas from some of the residents who had been involved in the initial recycling pilot and who had visited recycling programmes in other Swedish cities. The traditional refuse chutes in houses have been closed and all inhabitants now leave their waste for recycling at the recycling venues. Here, there are containers for paper, cardboard, coloured glass, uncoloured glass, metal, plastic and electronic waste, hazardous waste and batteries.                    					                					Food waste:Composting food waste started early on in the yards of the recycling venues, at that time the largest neighbourhood system in Sweden. More than a third of the waste was turned into fertile compost in less than eight weeks. In 2008, Augustenborg was chosen as a pilot area for separating food waste to make bio-gas. Within the pilot programme, all of the waste flows in the neighbourhood are being analysed and a new information campaign taking place. There is also collection of hazardous waste, electronics and fluorescent tubes. The collection of electronic waste generated 3,250 kg in the first six months.                    					                					Biogas car pool:Residents started a car pool in 2001 which now is a part of regional not-for-profit Skånes car pool. The car, fuelled by ethanol or biogas, is parked close to the square and is used by members in the area and from other parts of Malmö.                    									7. Cost and resources									This work has been supported by the government´s Local Investment Programme and also financed by key local partners within Malmö City and the MKB housing company. Supporters of the Botanical Roof Garden project included EU-LIFE and the Swedish Ministry of the Environment which cost over 12 million SEK. 									8. Effectiveness (i.e. were the foreseen goals/objectives of the work reached?)									The project was launched in 1998 and the results so far indicate that Augustenborg has become an attractive, multi-cultural neighbourhood in which the turnover of tenancies has decreased by almost 20% and  the environmental impact has decreased to a similar degree.									A number of initiatives have been undertaken throughout Augustenborg to increase resource efficiency by up to 20% compared to 1995 levels.  Measures to increase energy efficiency have been undertaken throughout the neighbourhood, optimising heating and hot water systems and cutting electricity use.  									Two electric-powered trains built as prototypes transported around 300 000 passengers to and from Augustenborg and surrounding neighbourhoods during two years. However, the line was closed down when it could not be made profitable and the trains had some technical problems. 									9. Success and Fail factors									Malmö has signed  the Covenant of Mayors initiative to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. The Covenant of Mayors is an EU initiative, which aims at improving energy efficiency significantly in the urban environment through a formal commitment by the cities to reduce their CO2 emissions.									Ideas from residents are behind many of the initiatives and residents, pupils and people working in the area have been involved in the design of the outdoor environment to create new habitat whilst increasing amenity. 									10. Unforeseen outcomes									The Augustenborg solar project was the starting point for Solar City Malmö which operates all over Malmö.The community is looking at innovative ways of using the roof gardens for food production. Bee-keeping is one example cashing in on the longer flowering season of city gardens. Tests conducted at Augustenborg showed no increased concentrations of heavy metals or other toxic substances in honey so produced. Some vegetables, or even better, drought tolerant herbs, can be grown in fairly thin soil layers or containers. To avoid fertiliser pollution, a system of re-circulated water is needed. Last but not least, for roofs that can take greater weight, fish are being grown in aquaponic facilities. 									11. Prepared by									A.H.

Research Institute for Knowledge Systems BV (RIKS) Ministry of Research  KRIM has the goal of providing orientation and action know-how for the future task of society entailing "risk management in coastal protection under conditions of uncertainty". The project has two major research questions: 
• What are the potential impacts of a climate change and adaptation measures? 
• What are possible consequences for risk management in coastal protection?

The product of the KRIM research and development process will consist of 3 components altogether:
* Discipline- and sector-oriented depictions of the analysis of the natural science, economic science and social science factors and their interdependencies (final reports of the subprojects);
* Systematic analysis and depiction of the risks expected at the different levels and their interrelationship with external factors of communication (jointly);
* An integrated computer-aided decision support system (DSS) that helps to structure the interdisciplinary research process, identify know-how gaps, compile the findings and make them available to society (SP "Integrative Analysis" with all subprojects Decision support systems

The project initially evaluates recent climate change scenarios, leading to predictions on the weather conditions in the future. Naturally, these may result in changes of the hydrological balance of the inland waterway network, being either associated with less ice formation and more balanced waterway conditions over the year or extreme situations such as prolonged low water periods or floods, depending on the region considered. The next step of the project is to evaluate the effect of these changes on the costs and reliability associated with inland waterway transport and other transport, which might lead to changes in transport flows. These calculations form the basis of a baseline scenario, assuming little or no deviation in policy related to IWT or other transport modes. In parallel with the construction of the reference scenario, we identify proper adaptation strategies for coping with possible climate change effects on IWT. We  assess them with respect to their applicability, implementation and costs. 

 Final results contain projections of service quality, flows on the inland waterway network under climate change conditions, as well as cost-benefit assessments of possible adaptation strategies. The project provides essential information for decision makers and guidelines for future research on climate change and IWT.

Experiences that can be exchanged									Soft interventions in a barrier-island system which include the reinforcement of the dunes using dredged sediments from an inner channel and the relocation of inlets based upon their natural dynamics. Such interventions can be successful in avoiding ocean over-wash while maintaining a good water exchange efficiency necessary to safeguard the ecological functioning of the system. 									4. Overview of the case									The Ria Formosa lagoon is a multi-use barrier-island system which has been showing progressive degradation and erosion but also infilling and meandering of some of its channels. This has been intensified by sea-level rise but also human activities (infrastructure, land reclamation that reduced the water body area and volume) which increased the risk of hazards. After a heavy winter storm, in 1995-96, that destroyed part of one of the peninsulas it was necessary to intervene. However, the interventions avoided hard protection techniques and respected the natural dynamics of the area.									5. Context and Objectives									a) Context									The Ria Formosa lagoon, in the South of Portugal, represents a barrier-island system and their geomorphological features are unique in Europe. It is a multi-use area, supporting important activities such as shellfish culture (representing the biggest clam producer in Portugal), salt production, tourism, recreation and leisure. At the same time it is considered a wetland of world interest, due to the importance and diversity of its habitats but also the fauna it houses, particularly resident and migrating birds. These features have granted it special protection status: it is a national Natural Park and is internationally recognised as Natura 2000 and Ramsar sites. 									Ria Formosa comprises 2 peninsulas (Ancão and Cacela) and 5 barrier-islands and the water exchange is made through six tidal inlets. Two of these inlets have been opened and stabilised with groynes, while the other four show different patterns and rates of eastward migration. The barriers have been showing a progressive degradation and significant reduction in their area during the last decades, due mainly to over-wash, foot-stepping and coastal erosion. At the same time, the periodic dredging made only in the navigation channels contributes to the diminishing of the water exchange in other parts of the system, which can threaten its ecology and the shellfish production.									It is recognised that the erosion affecting the barrier islands is being influenced by the several groynes installed in Vilamoura (west of Ria Formosa) and the ones in the two inlets, which have reduced the sediment drift eastwards. Furthermore, the heavy human occupation of some of the islands, particularly since the 1960’s construction of some illegal holiday houses and tourism related services in the western Peninsula of Ancão (known as Farol’s Island) is thought to affect the natural behaviour and resilience of the barriers, besides increasing significantly the risk of hazard to humans. During the 1995-1996 winter, extensive over-wash associated with storm events led to the destruction of the dune crest in several parts of the western Peninsula of Cacela, leading to the formation of a new inlet in its middle part, in front of Fábrica village. Simultaneously, the lagoon channel in the back barrier was gradually silting up. The continuity of over-wash events could further result in the narrowing of the inner channel, threatening the existing clam and oyster cultures and the exposure of the village to direct to wave action during storms.									b) Objectives									To protect the Fábrica village and safeguard the ecological functioning of the system, including the important economic activity of shellfish production, using soft protection techniques.									6. Implementation of the ICZM Approach (i.e. management, tools, resources)									a) Management									Natural Park of Ria Formosa (management entity of the project, which at the time had full responsibility over the area) and Institute for Nature Conservation and Biodiversity is the governmental body responsible for nature conservation and biodiversity policies, and for the management of Protected Areas, which co-financed the works. The Port Authority was the entity sub-contracted to supervise the dredging and provide assistance, and CIACOMAR, a research centre form the Univeristy of Algarve provided scientific advice and monitored the effects of the interventions, together with other research centres and Institutes.  									b) ICZM tools									Cacela Peninsula: Between October 1996 and February 1997 the channel of Cacela was dredged and the sediments were deposited on the western part of the Peninsula, forming an artificial dune ridge. The nourishment intended to increase the dune crest height to 5,5m above mean sea-level  (MSL) along the western 2000 m of the Peninsula, closing the inlet. Between April and August 1997, two longshore sets of fences were placed on the eastern 1200m of the replenished top to trap sediments and increase the dune height. In the beginning of 1998, dune vegetation (Amophila arenaria) was planted inside these fences and the natural flora succession began. To avoid the impact of foot-stepping, two above-ground, wooden paths were placed across the dune crest, as this peninsula is used for bathing activities during summer.									Inlets relocation: Ancão inlet was relocated in 1997, approximately 3.5 km west from its position in 1996. Fuzeta inlet was relocated in 1999, only 800 m from its position in 1996. The sediments were used to strengthen the dune barrier. 									7. Cost and resources									The estimated cost at the time was equivalent to €10 million for the overall project of recovery of the lagoon system (EU Cohesion Fund). The Ancão inlet operations cost around € 600,000. These values are the costs at the time.									8. Effectiveness (i.e. were the foreseen goals/objectives of the work reached?)									From the beginning of the operations, monitoring was conducted regarding beach and dune profiling, topography surveys in specific areas, water and sediment quality analysis, benthonic populations, water circulation, human occupation and risks to observe the morphological evolution of the area after the interventions.									Cacela Peninsula: The fences installed on the top of the replenishment showed a variable performance from site to site: during the first year increment of the dune crest varied up to 1,2 m. This difference was associated to the bluff height, since dune recovery was almost zero at places with bluff height of 2,5m and increased as the bluff height increased. On a global evaluation the interventions in Cacela accomplished their purposes, as no over-wash episodes and no new inlet formation have occurred in the subsequent years and only small silting up the inner channels was verified. 									Inlets: The Ancão inlet reached dynamic equilibrium only two years after its relocation and since then it has been behaving as expected according to its historical migrating patterns. The width of Fuzeta inlet channel continuously increased at very high rates until it reached its dynamic equilibrium in July 2000. These successful interventions represent one of the first of its kind worldwide.									9. Success and Fail factors									The experience shows that the position where a new inlet is open in relocation interventions is extremely important. The hydrodynamic conditions (both internal and external) at the relocation point and the historic patterns of inlet migration are both factors to be taken into account. The inner channel was not dredged to the design depth (4m below MSL) since rocky outcrops were found. The lack in available sediments resulted in a final difference on the nourishment elevation, with a high value (5,5 m) at the western end and lower (3,5) at the eastern one. The wash-over infilling showed little or no variation. However, the downdrift beaches and foredunes experienced severe erosion. It was estimated that 33% of the total 325,000 m3 of sediment deposited in the Cacela peninsula was eroded in the 2 years that followed the nourishment intervention. The overall process of decision-making was difficult and long but the deadlines associated with the funding mechanism speeded up the conclusions.									These interventions represented a rapid restoration of the area, keeping the natural values and protecting the populations while allowing the natural processes to take place. However, these types of intervention requires continual and periodic maintenance, as the natural evolution of this dynamic lagoon system would lead to a different state from the current one.									10.

The methodological approach is based on generic risk management framework that follows a standardised process starting from the identification of hazardous extreme weather phenomena, followed by impact assessment and concluded by mitigation and risk control measures.
In detail, the project will:
- Identify and define the hazards on EU transportation systems caused by extreme weather phenomena and develop relevant scenarios.
- Estimate the probabilities of harmful scenarios caused by extreme weather
- Estimate the consequences of extreme weather events based on developed scenarios - first on EU transport infrastructure, then on operations and finally on supply chains and mobility.
- Monetise the harmful consequences per transport mode both on infrastructure and operations (including mobility and supply chain impacts).
- Evaluate measures and options for negative impact reduction, control and monitoring in short and long-term.
- Analysis of different management and policy options and strategies.

relevant, field through a combination of:
New global science-based, long-term projections of human capital (population by age, sex
and level of education) as a key element of adaptive capacity;
Three empirical multi-national studies on key factors involved in past vulnerability and
adaptations to the Sahelian drought, Hurricane Mitch and the Asian tsunami;
Three prospective case studies assessing future adaptive capacity for the Phuket region,

The transect starts in Svalbard, includes the Scandinavian mountains, the Alps and ends in the Sierra Nevada in southern Spain. The aim of the project is to improve the knowledge on permafrost and, finally, the assessment of related hazards. The project contains several complementary investigations like geophysical surveys, microclimatic investigations, numerical modeling of permafrost distribution and physical modeling of permafrost related slope instability. 

 The first results (Harris et al. 2003) showed that the thermal permafrost gradients are consistent with the 20th century surface warming. Important to notice is further the uniqueness of the thermal profile at each site, which has a huge impact on risk assessment and related investigations required for determining the site specific features. For example, each thermal profile indicates a site specific depth of the lowest temperature as well as different permafrost temperatures and active layer depths. Factors influencing the thermal profiles are geothermal heat flux (warming the permafrost at its bottom), variations in lithology, the ground surface temperature and past changes of surface temperatures as well (Harris et al. 2003). Therefore, a big difficulty in predicting future permafrost changes is that the permafrost/thermal relationship is not in equilibrium, rather it is in part a function of the climate over the last decades and centuries (Harris et al. 2005).

Experiences that can be exchanged									Quantitative indicators have been developed for measuring and monitoring quality of sea, air and land environment. The indicators were developed for assessing and monitoring coastal biodiversity. A participatory planning procedure with about 30 stakeholders (hunting and fishing communities; authorities; universities and high schools) was created for coastal planning. Awareness raising via internet and meetings was also of great importance. 									4. Overview of the case									Sweden and Finland have been co-operating since 1995 to better manage the Kvarken region with respect to water contamination, air quality and the quality of the Kvarken Islands.									5. Context and Objectives									a) Context									Geographically, Kvarken-MittSkandia covers Helgeland in Norway, the county of Västerbotten and Örnsköldsvik Municipality in Sweden and the provinces of Österbotten, Central Österbotten and South Österbottenin in Finland. Västerbotten County and the Gulf of Bothnia region form a natural area of co-operation for both Sweden and Finland. The sea and the rivers which flow out of there, the issues of air quality and the Kvarken Archipelago knows no boundaries and therefore requires co-operation. Problems like sea water or air quality or the quality of the Kvarken islands are common to both, Finland and Sweden, and their management presumes co-operation. The Kvarken Miljö projects (2001-2007) were a continuation of environmental co-operation in this which region started in the 1990s.  									Knowledge of the region''s environment and development provides a basis for planning of environmental protection and nature conservation. In Kvarken, where nature is changing rapidly by natural means, it is necessary and scientifically very interesting to follow this natural development. Current information also increases the area''s image and status since Kvarken is environmentally attractive.									b) Objectives									Key themes for environmental work has been to co-ordinate environmental monitoring in the common maritime, anchoring co-operation in nature conservation areas and preparing a Kvarken Heritage proposal. One of the objectives is to develop this area into a kind of new ''power center'' in the area. 									6. Implementation of the ICZM Approach (i.e. management, tools, resources)									a) Management									Kvarken Miljö I  (2001 – 2003) consists of three initiatives, and Kvarken Miljö II (2004 – 2007) of two. They have common management and were carried out in various themes with their own operational working groups. The Board of the Regional Council in Västerbotten, Umeå municipality, the Regional Environmental Centre Western Finland, the City of Vasa and  Kvarken Council (Nordic Council of Ministers) were responsible.									b) ICZM tools									These initiatives were a continuation of the environmental co-operation undertaken within the Kvarken Council in the 1990s. Under the Green Bridge project, in the years 1995 - 1998, Kvarken nature was described. Also opportunities to co-ordinate management and the use of protected areas were investigated. The latter work was continued in the Achibal project. The goal of that project was to formulate general principles for the use of protected areas, and in particular the planning of their use for recreation and tourism.The Kvarken Miljö initiative can be divided into two phases: Part I and II. Part I lasted from 2001 to 2003 and was divided into the Green Bridge II, Urbana cultural sites and Environmental monitoring. The second part was from 2004 to 2007 and was divided into Green bridge III and Environmental monitoring and follow-up. It sought to increase the cross-border co-operation between authorities and present the cross-border work to a wider group, regionally and nationally. In the Green Bridge II, the preparation of Kvarken’s World Heritage application was taken to the end. Co-operative organisations were to be created and management of service structures were planned and implemented in Kvarken nature protection areas. Information and communication of this in various forms will be improved. In the monitoring work, a common environmental monitoring system was created for sea, air and land environment. The results were disseminated to the authorities and the public in the form of web pages and reports. In the work concerning urban cultural environments, proposals have been developed for legal protection, maintenance and renewal of the green structure in Vaasa and Umeå.									The overall objectives of the Kvarken Miljö II  was to achieve sustainable development in the coastal region, raise awareness and understanding of nature conservation and environmental protection and encourage the sustainable use of natural protected areas. More specifically, to identify common targets, deepen co-operation in coastal waters under the EU directives on water resources, involve more stakeholders in environmental and conservation work and create conditions for a broader dialogue on conservation issues.									7. Cost and resources									The costs of Kvarken Miljö I (2001-2003) was about  €1,1 m  and Kvarken Miljö II (2004 – 2007) about €1 m. They were co-financed with ERDF funds.									8. Effectiveness (i.e. were the foreseen goals/objectives of the work reached?)									It seems that in Kvarken Miljö I, ambitions and objectives were quite high.  Differences between Finland and Sweden existed in methodology on how to measure air quality in Ostrobothnia and Västerbotten; the sea monitoring programme was not prepared or presented. Finnish studies concerning bio-indicators were not directly applicable in Sweden; reference data concerning the impacts of tourism on nature was not utilised. Both of the initiatives were, however, productive, taking time-table and resources into account. 									9. Success and Fail factors									The world heritage status of Kvarken area has a great absolute value. The work emphasised joint investments from Finland and Sweden in the common waters. The initiative has also intensified participation between stakeholders (local people, land owners, authorities etc.) in planning of nature protection areas; it has reduced the distance between authorities and civil servants on both sides of Kvarken; the project has in general raised awareness of interests and other stakeholders participating in environmental planning procedures, and, at the same time, created a common identity in the Kvarken region.									In the environmental sector, environmental objectives are directly connected to national planning, decision-making and monitoring systems. Finland and Sweden applies, at least partly, planning practices of their own which may complicate co-operation between them. The Finnish environmental legislation is partly dissimilar to that of Sweden, which also may, from time to time, make co-operation in environmental issues more difficult. Quantitativeand qualitative indicators for measuring water, air and environmental quality were important tools in this case. Participatory planning was of great importance in integrating development of the Kvarken area. Awareness raising via internet and participatory working processes was a necessary pre-requisite for implementation of the Kvarken miljö initiative. 									10. Unforeseen outcomes									The idea of developing common principles for municipal planning procedures seemed to be a more difficult task than the developers could anticipate in advance. One of the reasons was different environmental planning systems in Finland and Sweden. The other reason was the character of the planning processes: because of participatory planning, it was not possible to steer the planning procedure from above. 									11.

PEGASO will use the model of the existing ICZM Protocol for the Mediterranean and adjust it to the needs of the Black Sea through three innovative actions:
*Constructing an ICZM governance platform as a bridge between scientist and end?user communities, going far beyond a conventional bridging. 
* Refine and further develop efficient and easy to use tools for making sustainability assessments in the coastal zone (indicators,accounting methods, models and scenarios).  They will be tested and validated in a multi?scale approach for integrated regional assessment through a number of relevant pilot sites. 
* Implementation of a Spatial Data Infrastructure (SDI), following the INSPIRE Directive, to organize and standardize spatial data to support information sharing on an interactive visor, to make it available to the ICZM Platform, and to disseminate all results of the project to the end users and interested parties.

In particular, the project will develop and apply a general, spatial model integrating climate change scenarios, ecosystem dynamics, response thresholds, ecosystem services supply and management options. 
The general model will be tested and validated on the basis of three case studies, focussing on: 
(i) flood protection in the Netherlands; 
(ii) impacts of climate change in northern Norway; and 
(iii) optimising land use including production of biofuels stock in Kalimantan, Indonesia. 
The first two areas are particularly vulnerable to climate change, and the third area is relevant because of its importance as a source of biofuel (palmoil) with associated environmental and social impacts. Each case study will be implemented in collaboration with local and international partners, and will result in the identification of economic efficient, sustainable and equitable local adaptation options. The scientific innovation of the project lies in the application of an ecosystem services approach to analyse adaptation options, the integration of complex ecosystem dynamics and societal impacts, and the spatially explicit modelling of economic benefits supplied by ecosystems.

The Baltic Sea is subject to severe environmental degradation caused by commercial and leisure activities such as dredging, fisheries, tourism, coastal development and land based pollution sources, placing increasing pressures on vulnerable marine habitats and natural resources. 

Conflicting priorities and lack of integrated management planning is a key obstacle for resolving the current state of affairs. An ecosystem-based approach to management, based on transnational spatial planning, would be a strong tool to overcome this challenge.

It will be based on 4 transnational pilot areas demonstrating the economical and environmental value of habitat maps and marine spatial planning (exemplified through 2 zoning plans). The tools and zoning plans integrates biological, geological and oceanographic data with local knowledge from stakeholders;

Overview of the case									The work entailed the development of a methodological framework so that twenty seven indicators of sustainable development (SD) could be compared around the European littoral. The framework also included a Standard Indicator Format, a Reporting Sheet and an Indicator Fact Sheet.									5. Context and Objectives									a) Context									For the implementation of ICZM, the Directorate-General of Environment (DG-ENV) of the European Commission set up the European ICZM expert group. It is composed of all 22 coastal Member States. This expert group recognized the importance of indicators and created an &quot;indicators and data&quot; working group (WG-ID) led by the European Topic Centre on Terrestrial Environment. The WG-ID was instructed to draw up a list of indicators and assist in coordinating the definition of the way in which the Member States should calculate the indicators. At the end of 2003, after a thorough review of all existing indicators for the coast and for Sustainable Development (SD), the WG-ID proposed that Member States and candidate countries employ two sets of indicators to be used alongside each other. One set should measure the progress of the implementation of ICZM i.e. a Progress Indicator Set (the subject of a separate case study). The second set should be able to monitor sustainable development of the coastal zone i.e. a Sustainable Development Set. A core set of 27 SD indicators, composed of 46 measurements, was put forward and rigorously tested. Using the two indicator sets together would give an indication as to whether progress was being made in the imlementation of ICZM and whether that progress was actually leading to increased sustainability at the coast. The indicators measuring progress in achieving sustainable development of the coast will in turn feed back to give policymakers an indication of the need for further action in ICZM. 									The 27 SD indicators were grouped into seven “goals” viz. To control further development of the undeveloped coast as appropriate, To protect, enhance and celebrate natural and cultural diversity, To promote and support a dynamic and sustainable coastal economy, To ensure that beaches are clean and that coastal waters are unpolluted, To reduce social exclusion and promote social cohesion at the coast, To use natural resources wisely, To recognise the threat to coastal zones posed by climate change and to ensure appropriate and ecologically responsible coastal protection. The 27 SD indicators, composed of 46 measurements, was put forward and tested. 									b) Objectives									To give a common methodological framework for calculating and reporting the 27 SD indicators (based on the availability of data, calculation experiences and the analysis of the weaknesses and strengths of the development and testing process). The work also illustrates the usefulness of the coastal indicator approach to develop ICZM within EU, national and regional strategies and planning.									6. Implementation of the ICZM Approach (i.e. management, tools, resources)									a) Management									The work was led by the Government of Catalonia and involved the following institutions: El Prat de Llobregat local council, Spain, Viladecans local council, Spain, Autonomous University of Barcelona – European Topic Centre on Terrestrial Environment (ETC-TE), European Environment Agency, Spain, French Institute for the Environment (IFEN, representing the French Ministry for the Environment), Malta Environment and Planning Authority (MEPA), Malta, Province of West Flanders, Belgium, University of Latvia, Latvia, and the Maritime Institute in Gdansk, Poland. 									b) ICZM tools									In order to be able to measure the individual indicators, a common framework was needed in order to benchmark, compare and visualise the state of the coast in Europe. Therefore, a Methodological Framework for the full set of 27 indicators was drawn up. This framework consists of  (1) a Standard Indicator Format which defines and describes the methodology of calculation for each measurement, (2) a Reporting Sheet which captures the results of calculations in terms of output (data, graph or map) and evaluation of the obtained values and data production process, and (3) an Indicator Fact Sheet which summarises and disseminates the main information obtained by partners on each indicator. The graphs, maps and comparative analysis are its main components.									7. Cost and resources									No costs are available.									8. Effectiveness (i.e. were the foreseen goals/objectives of the work reached?)									The Methodological Framework provides a powerful tool for a standardised measurement of the current state of the coast, to support better-informed decision-making and to promote objective and transparent communication on the efficient use of public funds. Its explanatory and suggestive power is particularly useful to show trends and linkages between related policy domains. 									9. Success and Fail factors									The standardisation of methodology and formats for compilation and presentation of results ensures the comparability, correct assessment and aggregation of the results obtained in different countries and at different scales around Europe. Moreover, the identification of data gaps or limitations will allow prioritisation of effort on the monitoring of required datasets. The Indicators Guidelines contribute to the analysis of the indicators-based approach as a common tool to support the policy integration process since common indicators streamline integrated information management among different stakeholders. However, good, reliable data sets are required.									Unfortunately, there is still no final agreement on the common indicators to be used around Europe’s littoral. The general opinion is that some of the indicators are only regionally valuable and there are too many to be measured. Nonetheless, the methodological framework is now in place for those that may eventually be chosen. Many of the indicators are not, in most cases, a measurement of true sustainability but are more related to state-of-the-coast indicators.									10. Unforeseen outcomes									None. 									11.

To support policy and planning decisions that will help wildlife to adapt to climate change, BRANCH developed a ‘Decision testing framework’. This can be used to assess the adaptation measures or actions that are needed to help ‘future proof’ planning decisions.
For our coasts a transferable methodology was developed using baseline habitat surveys and habitat modelling (see Annex 3, Final report). In the UK for the South Coast, BRANCH partners assessed habitat distributions using Aerial Photographic Interpretation data at six sites. This data is freely available from Local Records Centres in the UK for the whole of the South East coast (see contacts page). Changes in the extent of intertidal habitat under sea-level rise were modelled for the next 80 years. Modelled outputs were then used to create visualisations of the sites. This visualisation methodology can be used by coastal managers to visualise changes in future coastal landscapes arising from future climate change. It was also tested for the first time at the Baie des Vaies in Normandy, France (see Chapter 7, Annex 3).
BRANCH carried out three terrestrial case studies. These informed adaptation strategies (see Annex 4, Final report, ) that planners can use to increase adaptation options for wildlife, including planning where to create new site for nature and improve ecological networks. In Kent, UK, partners developed a for working with local stakeholders to design ecological networks as a climate change adaptation strategy.

Overview of the case									Denmark has set up three distinct bodies as part of its National Adaptation Strategy. These are to advise the government, oversee the transference of information to stakeholders and the general public and to coordinate research into climate adaptation to inform policy formulation. 									5. Context and Objectives									a) Context									Climate Change is widely accepted to be threatening mankind’s livelihood. Adaptation to the prospects of an altered future climate is needed across a range of societal sectors, including coastal zone management, construction and planning, water resource management, energy supply, agriculture, land use and forestry, fisheries, nature management, the health sector, disaster relief, the insurance sector, and many others. However, the development and implementation of robust adaptation measures needs to be informed by the best available research – building on findings from a broad range of scientific disciplines – and disseminated appropriately. The Danish government’s ‘Strategy for Adaptation to Climate Change in Denmark’ identified a need to strengthen the coordination of national activities in the context of climate change adaptation and to ensure that synergies across a broad range of different research areas are harvested and disseminated. Therefore, the Danish Government has established three different bodies to ensure knowledge, coordination and research of climate adaptation viz. a coordination forum, an information centre and a coordination unit for research.									b) Objectives									The objectives of the three bodies are to provide climate change expertise and advice to the government as well as providing information to a wide audience including the general public whilst strengthening synergies between research activities related to climate change adaptation with a  view to providing solid information to societal decision-making processes.									6. Implementation of the ICZM Approach (i.e. management, tools, resources)									The ongoing ministerial responsibility will continue to lie with the individual sector ministries with respect to the coordination forum since they are responsible for implementing the relevant initiatives. The Information Centre for Climate Adaptation has been set up within the Ministry of Climate &amp; Energy and the Danish Energy Agency. The coordination unit has a three-level management structure: Steering Committee, Secretariat and Science Advisory Group, each with a clear and distinct role. 									b) ICZM tools									The Coordination Forum is a broad spectrum of bodies and institutions as well as municipalities and regions. This new forum monitors climate developments, research in the area, and the experience of other countries. It advises the Danish Government.									The information centre will ensure that the initiatives from the Coordination Forum are implemented. It is also meant to develop planning tools for state and municipal authorities. The Centre will inform authorities, businesses and citizens about the Government’s Strategy for adaptation to a changing climate. It is meant to collect, systematise and pass on all the nationally and internationally available information about climate adaptation to a wider audience and provide general information on the subject. For all Danish citizens to have access to this updated information about adaptation to climate change, a web-portal (www.klimatilpasning.dk) has been established with information about climate change. The portal provides the public, authorities and businesses with information about climate changes and their influence on society. Furthermore, it will give practical information about climate adaptation. The portal is under constant development and will include: updated data and maps of temperatures, precipitation, sea and groundwater; articles and guidance about areas in various sectors affected by climate changes; practical advice on climate adaptation; examples of calculations of how climate change may be included as a basis for important decisions; useful analysis and assessment tools for the public and decision-makers; and information about the latest research and development into adaptation to climate change.									The Coordination Unit (in Danish: Koordineringsenhed for Forskning i klimaTilpasning or KFT) is a joint endeavour by the National Environmental Research Institute at the University of Aarhus, Denmark’s Meteorological Institute, the Geological Survey of Denmark and Greenland, University of Copenhagen and Denmark’s Technical University. It is meant to give an overview of Danish research into adaptation to a changed climate and place this information at the disposal of the Information Centre and its climate adaptation portal. The purpose of the Coordination Unit is: to coordinate national-level research activities on adaptation to climate change; to facilitate research synergies and identify knowledge gaps; to support transfer of knowledge to collate authoritative data on climate change and its impacts; and to foster national and international networks. It will thus coordinate research across the many research centres working with climate and also ensure updated data on the climate of the future. It refers to the Coordination Forum and supports the Information Centre which interacts with the stakeholders, sectors and the different authority levels. The work programme is endorsed by the Steering Committee and primarily implemented at four distinct working levels: secretarial tasks, flexible working groups which focus on thematically cross-cutting adaptation-related issues, an adaptation research network which provides a pool of interested researchers and specific tasks. Key outcomes and products foreseen to result from the unit’s activities over the next years include:					                					KFT Research Briefs: Research Briefs are 10 to 20 page summaries of the current state-of-the-art in a particular field of research related to climate change adaptation. They are requested by the Steering Committee, based on the recommendation of Advisory Group and secretariat. They are produced by Working Groups and reviewed by the Advisory Group. KFT Briefs: These Briefs are 2 to 10 page notes on policy relevant issues related to current research on climate change adaptation. These Briefs can either be requested by the Steering Committee (based on requests by the inter-ministerial coordination group) or developed on the initiative of the secretariat. KFT briefs are reviewed and approved by the Steering Committee.Database of researchers and on-going research activities: A key task of the secretariat is to develop and maintain a database of on-going research activities in Denmark and Europe. This database is geared to find synergies between and gaps in current research activities. At first this database will be for internal use only; however, this may later develop into a web-based application.Input into the web-portal: Another key task of the secretariat is to facilitate input into the web-portal hosted by the Information Centre.Newsletters: A regular Newsletter (at least every three months) will be drafted and distributed by the secretariat. The newsletter summarises activities by the secretariat, updates on selected on-going research activities, informs on key national and international developments in the area of climate adaptation research, reports on working groups and other activities initiated by the unit, etc.                    									In addition, other ad hoc outcomes may also result through input to other cross-cutting reports (e.g.  the Miljøtilstandsrapport 2009), input to international assessments (e.g. as prepared by the IPCC, OECD, EEA) or other dedicated background reports (e.g. a report on Danish adaptation research in the run up to COP 2009).									7. Cost and resources									The secretariat of the coordination unit is staffed by 8-10 persons.									8. Effectiveness (i.e. were the foreseen goals/objectives of the work reached?)									The coordination unit will focus on ways of adapting to climate change. For example, there is a great need for economic tools which can take climate change into account when making decisions on climate adaptation (rather than research showing that the climate is actually changing or how emissions of greenhouse gases can be limited).									9. Success and Fail factors									The activities necessarily build on strong cooperation across a wide range of scientific disciplines as well as regular interaction with both the policy-makers and other stakeholders.									10.

establishing a framework for Community action in the field of water policy


THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,

Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, and in particular Article 175(1) thereof,

Having regard to the proposal from the Commission(1),

Having regard to the opinion of the Economic and Social Committee(2),

Having regard to the opinion of the Committee of the Regions(3),

Acting in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 251 of the Treaty(4), and in the light of the joint text approved by the Conciliation Committee on 18 July 2000,

Whereas:

(1) Water is not a commercial product like any other but, rather, a heritage which must be protected, defended and treated as such.

(2) The conclusions of the Community Water Policy Ministerial Seminar in Frankfurt in 1988 highlighted the need for Community legislation covering ecological quality. The Council in its resolution of 28 June 1988(5) asked the Commission to submit proposals to improve ecological quality in Community surface waters.

(3) The declaration of the Ministerial Seminar on groundwater held at The Hague in 1991 recognised the need for action to avoid long-term deterioration of freshwater quality and quantity and called for a programme of actions to be implemented by the year 2000 aiming at sustainable management and protection of freshwater resources. In its resolutions of 25 February 1992(6), and 20 February 1995(7), the Council requested an action programme for groundwater and a revision of Council Directive 80/68/EEC of 17 December 1979 on the protection of groundwater against pollution caused by certain dangerous substances(8), as part of an overall policy on freshwater protection.

(4) Waters in the Community are under increasing pressure from the continuous growth in demand for sufficient quantities of good quality water for all purposes. On 10 November 1995, the European Environment Agency in its report "Environment in the European Union - 1995" presented an updated state of the environment report, confirming the need for action to protect Community waters in qualitative as well as in quantitative terms.

(5) On 18 December 1995, the Council adopted conclusions requiring, inter alia, the drawing up of a new framework Directive establishing the basic principles of sustainable water policy in the European Union and inviting the Commission to come forward with a proposal.

(6) On 21 February 1996 the Commission adopted a communication to the European Parliament and the Council on European Community water policy setting out the principles for a Community water policy.

(7) On 9 September 1996 the Commission presented a proposal for a Decision of the European Parliament and of the Council on an action programme for integrated protection and management of groundwater(9). In that proposal the Commission pointed to the need to establish procedures for the regulation of abstraction of freshwater and for the monitoring of freshwater quality and quantity.

(8) On 29 May 1995 the Commission adopted a communication to the European Parliament and the Council on the wise use and conservation of wetlands, which recognised the important functions they perform for the protection of water resources.

(9) It is necessary to develop an integrated Community policy on water.

(10) The Council on 25 June 1996, the Committee of the Regions on 19 September 1996, the Economic and Social Committee on 26 September 1996, and the European Parliament on 23 October 1996 all requested the Commission to come forward with a proposal for a Council Directive establishing a framework for a European water policy.

(11) As set out in Article 174 of the Treaty, the Community policy on the environment is to contribute to pursuit of the objectives of preserving, protecting and improving the quality of the environment, in prudent and rational utilisation of natural resources, and to be based on the precautionary principle and on the principles that preventive action should be taken, environmental damage should, as a priority, be rectified at source and that the polluter should pay.

(12) Pursuant to Article 174 of the Treaty, in preparing its policy on the environment, the Community is to take account of available scientific and technical data, environmental conditions in the various regions of the Community, and the economic and social development of the Community as a whole and the balanced development of its regions as well as the potential benefits and costs of action or lack of action.

(13) There are diverse conditions and needs in the Community which require different specific solutions. This diversity should be taken into account in the planning and execution of measures to ensure protection and sustainable use of water in the framework of the river basin. Decisions should be taken as close as possible to the locations where water is affected or used. Priority should be given to action within the responsibility of Member States through the drawing up of programmes of measures adjusted to regional and local conditions.

(14) The success of this Directive relies on close cooperation and coherent action at Community, Member State and local level as well as on information, consultation and involvement of the public, including users.

(15) The supply of water is a service of general interest as defined in the Commission communication on services of general interest in Europe(10).

(16) Further integration of protection and sustainable management of water into other Community policy areas such as energy, transport, agriculture, fisheries, regional policy and tourism is necessary. This Directive should provide a basis for a continued dialogue and for the development of strategies towards a further integration of policy areas. This Directive can also make an important contribution to other areas of cooperation between Member States, inter alia, the European spatial development perspective (ESDP).

(17) An effective and coherent water policy must take account of the vulnerability of aquatic ecosystems located near the coast and estuaries or in gulfs or relatively closed seas, as their equilibrium is strongly influenced by the quality of inland waters flowing into them. Protection of water status within river basins will provide economic benefits by contributing towards the protection of fish populations, including coastal fish populations.

(18) Community water policy requires a transparent, effective and coherent legislative framework. The Community should provide common principles and the overall framework for action. This Directive should provide for such a framework and coordinate and integrate, and, in a longer perspective, further develop the overall principles and structures for protection and sustainable use of water in the Community in accordance with the principles of subsidiarity.

(19) This Directive aims at maintaining and improving the aquatic environment in the Community. This purpose is primarily concerned with the quality of the waters concerned. Control of quantity is an ancillary element in securing good water quality and therefore measures on quantity, serving the objective of ensuring good quality, should also be established.

(20) The quantitative status of a body of groundwater may have an impact on the ecological quality of surface waters and terrestrial ecosystems associated with that groundwater body.

(21) The Community and Member States are party to various international agreements containing important obligations on the protection of marine waters from pollution, in particular the Convention on the Protection of the Marine Environment of the Baltic Sea Area, signed in Helsinki on 9 April 1992 and approved by Council Decision 94/157/EC(11), the Convention for the Protection of the Marine Environment of the North-East Atlantic, signed in Paris on 22 September 1992 and approved by Council Decision 98/249/EC(12), and the Convention for the Protection of the Mediterranean Sea Against Pollution, signed in Barcelona on 16 February 1976 and approved by Council Decision 77/585/EEC(13), and its Protocol for the Protection of the Mediterranean Sea Against Pollution from Land-Based Sources, signed in Athens on 17 May 1980 and approved by Council Decision 83/101/EEC(14). This Directive is to make a contribution towards enabling the Community and Member States to meet those obligations.

(22) This Directive is to contribute to the progressive reduction of emissions of hazardous substances to water.

(23) Common principles are needed in order to coordinate Member States'' efforts to improve the protection of Community waters in terms of quantity and quality, to promote sustainable water use, to contribute to the control of transboundary water problems, to protect aquatic ecosystems, and terrestrial ecosystems and wetlands directly depending on them, and to safeguard and develop the potential uses of Community waters.

(24) Good water quality will contribute to securing the drinking water supply for the population.

(25) Common definitions of the status of water in terms of quality and, where relevant for the purpose of the environmental protection, quantity should be established. Environmental objectives should be set to ensure that good status of surface water and groundwater is achieved throughout the Community and that deterioration in the status of waters is prevented at Community level.

(26) Member States should aim to achieve the objective of at least good water status by defining and implementing the necessary measures within integrated programmes of measures, taking into account existing Community requirements. Where good water status already exists, it should be maintained. For groundwater, in addition to the requirements of good status, any significant and sustained upward trend in the concentration of any pollutant should be identified and reversed.

(27) The ultimate aim of this Directive is to achieve the elimination of priority hazardous substances and contribute to achieving concentrations in the marine environment near background values for naturally occurring substances.

(28) Surface waters and groundwaters are in principle renewable natural resources; in particular, the task of ensuring good status of groundwater requires early action and stable long-term planning of protective measures, owing to the natural time lag in its formation and renewal. Such time lag for improvement should be taken into account in timetables when establishing measures for the achievement of good status of groundwater and reversing any significant and sustained upward trend in the concentration of any pollutant in groundwater.

(29) In aiming to achieve the objectives set out in this Directive, and in establishing a programme of measures to that end, Member States may phase implementation of the programme of measures in order to spread the costs of implementation.

(30) In order to ensure a full and consistent implementation of this Directive any extensions of timescale should be made on the basis of appropriate, evident and transparent criteria and be justified by the Member States in the river basin management plans.

(31) In cases where a body of water is so affected by human activity or its natural condition is such that it may be unfeasible or unreasonably expensive to achieve good status, less stringent environmental objectives may be set on the basis of appropriate, evident and transparent criteria, and all practicable steps should be taken to prevent any further deterioration of the status of waters.

(32) There may be grounds for exemptions from the requirement to prevent further deterioration or to achieve good status under specific conditions, if the failure is the result of unforeseen or exceptional circumstances, in particular floods and droughts, or, for reasons of overriding public interest, of new modifications to the physical characteristics of a surface water body or alterations to the level of bodies of groundwater, provided that all practicable steps are taken to mitigate the adverse impact on the status of the body of water.

(33) The objective of achieving good water status should be pursued for each river basin, so that measures in respect of surface water and groundwaters belonging to the same ecological, hydrological and hydrogeological system are coordinated.

(34) For the purposes of environmental protection there is a need for a greater integration of qualitative and quantitative aspects of both surface waters and groundwaters, taking into account the natural flow conditions of water within the hydrological cycle.

(35) Within a river basin where use of water may have transboundary effects, the requirements for the achievement of the environmental objectives established under this Directive, and in particular all programmes of measures, should be coordinated for the whole of the river basin district. For river basins extending beyond the boundaries of the Community, Member States should endeavour to ensure the appropriate coordination with the relevant non-member States. This Directive is to contribute to the implementation of Community obligations under international conventions on water protection and management, notably the United Nations Convention on the protection and use of transboundary water courses and international lakes, approved by Council Decision 95/308/EC(15) and any succeeding agreements on its application.

(36) It is necessary to undertake analyses of the characteristics of a river basin and the impacts of human activity as well as an economic analysis of water use. The development in water status should be monitored by Member States on a systematic and comparable basis throughout the Community. This information is necessary in order to provide a sound basis for Member States to develop programmes of measures aimed at achieving the objectives established under this Directive.

(37) Member States should identify waters used for the abstraction of drinking water and ensure compliance with Council Directive 80/778/EEC of 15 July 1980 relating to the quality of water intended for human consumption(16).

(38) The use of economic instruments by Member States may be appropriate as part of a programme of measures. The principle of recovery of the costs of water services, including environmental and resource costs associated with damage or negative impact on the aquatic environment should be taken into account in accordance with, in particular, the polluter-pays principle. An economic analysis of water services based on long-term forecasts of supply and demand for water in the river basin district will be necessary for this purpose.

(39) There is a need to prevent or reduce the impact of incidents in which water is accidentally polluted. Measures with the aim of doing so should be included in the programme of measures.

(40) With regard to pollution prevention and control, Community water policy should be based on a combined approach using control of pollution at source through the setting of emission limit values and of environmental quality standards.

(41) For water quantity, overall principles should be laid down for control on abstraction and impoundment in order to ensure the environmental sustainability of the affected water systems.

(42) Common environmental quality standards and emission limit values for certain groups or families of pollutants should be laid down as minimum requirements in Community legislation. Provisions for the adoption of such standards at Community level should be ensured.

(43) Pollution through the discharge, emission or loss of priority hazardous substances must cease or be phased out. The European Parliament and the Council should, on a proposal from the Commission, agree on the substances to be considered for action as a priority and on specific measures to be taken against pollution of water by those substances, taking into account all significant sources and identifying the cost-effective and proportionate level and combination of controls.

(44) In identifying priority hazardous substances, account should be taken of the precautionary principle, relying in particular on the determination of any potentially adverse effects of the product and on a scientific assessment of the risk.

(45) Member States should adopt measures to eliminate pollution of surface water by the priority substances and progressively to reduce pollution by other substances which would otherwise prevent Member States from achieving the objectives for the bodies of surface water.

(46) To ensure the participation of the general public including users of water in the establishment and updating of river basin management plans, it is necessary to provide proper information of planned measures and to report on progress with their implementation with a view to the involvement of the general public before final decisions on the necessary measures are adopted.

(47) This Directive should provide mechanisms to address obstacles to progress in improving water status when these fall outside the scope of Community water legislation, with a view to developing appropriate Community strategies for overcoming them.

(48) The Commission should present annually an updated plan for any initiatives which it intends to propose for the water sector.

(49) Technical specifications should be laid down to ensure a coherent approach in the Community as part of this Directive. Criteria for evaluation of water status are an important step forward. Adaptation of certain technical elements to technical development and the standardisation of monitoring, sampling and analysis methods should be adopted by committee procedure. To promote a thorough understanding and consistent application of the criteria for characterisation of the river basin districts and evaluation of water status, the Commission may adopt guidelines on the application of these criteria.

(50) The measures necessary for the implementation of this Directive should be adopted in accordance with Council Decision 1999/468/EC of 28 June 1999 laying down the procedures for the exercise of implementing powers conferred on the Commission(17).

(51) The implementation of this Directive is to achieve a level of protection of waters at least equivalent to that provided in certain earlier acts, which should therefore be repealed once the relevant provisions of this Directive have been fully implemented.

(52) The provisions of this Directive take over the framework for control of pollution by dangerous substances established under Directive 76/464/EEC(18). That Directive should therefore be repealed once the relevant provisions of this Directive have been fully implemented.

(53) Full implementation and enforcement of existing environmental legislation for the protection of waters should be ensured. It is necessary to ensure the proper application of the provisions implementing this Directive throughout the Community by appropriate penalties provided for in Member States'' legislation. Such penalties should be effective, proportionate and dissuasive,

HAVE ADOPTED THIS DIRECTIVE:


Article 1

Purpose

The purpose of this Directive is to establish a framework for the protection of inland surface waters, transitional waters, coastal waters and groundwater which:

(a) prevents further deterioration and protects and enhances the status of aquatic ecosystems and, with regard to their water needs, terrestrial ecosystems and wetlands directly depending on the aquatic ecosystems;

(b) promotes sustainable water use based on a long-term protection of available water resources;

(c) aims at enhanced protection and improvement of the aquatic environment, inter alia, through specific measures for the progressive reduction of discharges, emissions and losses of priority substances and the cessation or phasing-out of discharges, emissions and losses of the priority hazardous substances;

(d) ensures the progressive reduction of pollution of groundwater and prevents its further pollution, and

(e) contributes to mitigating the effects of floods and droughts

and thereby contributes to:

- the provision of the sufficient supply of good quality surface water and groundwater as needed for sustainable, balanced and equitable water use,

- a significant reduction in pollution of groundwater,

- the protection of territorial and marine waters, and

- achieving the objectives of relevant international agreements, including those which aim to prevent and eliminate pollution of the marine environment, by Community action under Article 16(3) to cease or phase out discharges, emissions and losses of priority hazardous substances, with the ultimate aim of achieving concentrations in the marine environment near background values for naturally occurring substances and close to zero for man-made synthetic substances.

(c) for protected areas

Member States shall achieve compliance with any standards and objectives at the latest 15 years after the date of entry into force of this Directive, unless otherwise specified in the Community legislation under which the individual protected areas have been established.

2. Where more than one of the objectives under paragraph 1 relates to a given body of water, the most stringent shall apply.

3. Member States may designate a body of surface water as artificial or heavily modified, when:

(a) the changes to the hydromorphological characteristics of that body which would be necessary for achieving good ecological status would have significant adverse effects on:

(i) the wider environment;

(ii) navigation, including port facilities, or recreation;

(iii) activities for the purposes of which water is stored, such as drinking-water supply, power generation or irrigation;

(iv) water regulation, flood protection, land drainage, or

(v) other equally important sustainable human development activities;

(b) the beneficial objectives served by the artificial or modified characteristics of the water body cannot, for reasons of technical feasibility or disproportionate costs, reasonably be achieved by other means, which are a significantly better environmental option.

Such designation and the reasons for it shall be specifically mentioned in the river basin management plans required under Article 13 and reviewed every six years.

4. The deadlines established under paragraph 1 may be extended for the purposes of phased achievement of the objectives for bodies of water, provided that no further deterioration occurs in the status of the affected body of water when all of the following conditions are met:

(a) Member States determine that all necessary improvements in the status of bodies of water cannot reasonably be achieved within the timescales set out in that paragraph for at least one of the following reasons:

(i) the scale of improvements required can only be achieved in phases exceeding the timescale, for reasons of technical feasibility;

(ii) completing the improvements within the timescale would be disproportionately expensive;

(iii) natural conditions do not allow timely improvement in the status of the body of water.

(b) Extension of the deadline, and the reasons for it, are specifically set out and explained in the river basin management plan required under Article 13.

(c) Extensions shall be limited to a maximum of two further updates of the river basin management plan except in cases where the natural conditions are such that the objectives cannot be achieved within this period.

(d) A summary of the measures required under Article 11 which are envisaged as necessary to bring the bodies of water progressively to the required status by the extended deadline, the reasons for any significant delay in making these measures operational, and the expected timetable for their implementation are set out in the river basin management plan. A review of the implementation of these measures and a summary of any additional measures shall be included in updates of the river basin management plan.

5. Member States may aim to achieve less stringent environmental objectives than those required under paragraph 1 for specific bodies of water when they are so affected by human activity, as determined in accordance with Article 5(1), or their natural condition is such that the achievement of these objectives would be infeasible or disproportionately expensive, and all the following conditions are met:

(a) the environmental and socioeconomic needs served by such human activity cannot be achieved by other means, which are a significantly better environmental option not entailing disproportionate costs;

(b) Member States ensure,

- for surface water, the highest ecological and chemical status possible is achieved, given impacts that could not reasonably have been avoided due to the nature of the human activity or pollution,

- for groundwater, the least possible changes to good groundwater status, given impacts that could not reasonably have been avoided due to the nature of the human activity or pollution;

(c) no further deterioration occurs in the status of the affected body of water;

(d) the establishment of less stringent environmental objectives, and the reasons for it, are specifically mentioned in the river basin management plan required under Article 13 and those objectives are reviewed every six years.

6. Temporary deterioration in the status of bodies of water shall not be in breach of the requirements of this Directive if this is the result of circumstances of natural cause or force majeure which are exceptional or could not reasonably have been foreseen, in particular extreme floods and prolonged droughts, or the result of circumstances due to accidents which could not reasonably have been foreseen, when all of the following conditions have been met:

(a) all practicable steps are taken to prevent further deterioration in status and in order not to compromise the achievement of the objectives of this Directive in other bodies of water not affected by those circumstances;

(b) the conditions under which circumstances that are exceptional or that could not reasonably have been foreseen may be declared, including the adoption of the appropriate indicators, are stated in the river basin management plan;

(c) the measures to be taken under such exceptional circumstances are included in the programme of measures and will not compromise the recovery of the quality of the body of water once the circumstances are over;

(d) the effects of the circumstances that are exceptional or that could not reasonably have been foreseen are reviewed annually and, subject to the reasons set out in paragraph 4(a), all practicable measures are taken with the aim of restoring the body of water to its status prior to the effects of those circumstances as soon as reasonably practicable, and

(e) a summary of the effects of the circumstances and of such measures taken or to be taken in accordance with paragraphs (a) and (d) are included in the next update of the river basin management plan.

7. Member States will not be in breach of this Directive when:

- failure to achieve good groundwater status, good ecological status or, where relevant, good ecological potential or to prevent deterioration in the status of a body of surface water or groundwater is the result of new modifications to the physical characteristics of a surface water body or alterations to the level of bodies of groundwater, or

- failure to prevent deterioration from high status to good status of a body of surface water is the result of new sustainable human development activities

and all the following conditions are met:

(a) all practicable steps are taken to mitigate the adverse impact on the status of the body of water;

(b) the reasons for those modifications or alterations are specifically set out and explained in the river basin management plan required under Article 13 and the objectives are reviewed every six years;

(c) the reasons for those modifications or alterations are of overriding public interest and/or the benefits to the environment and to society of achieving the objectives set out in paragraph 1 are outweighed by the benefits of the new modifications or alterations to human health, to the maintenance of human safety or to sustainable development, and

(d) the beneficial objectives served by those modifications or alterations of the water body cannot for reasons of technical feasibility or disproportionate cost be achieved by other means, which are a significantly better environmental option.

8. When applying paragraphs 3, 4, 5, 6 and 7, a Member State shall ensure that the application does not permanently exclude or compromise the achievement of the objectives of this Directive in other bodies of water within the same river basin district and is consistent with the implementation of other Community environmental legislation.

9. Steps must be taken to ensure that the application of the new provisions, including the application of paragraphs 3, 4, 5, 6 and 7, guarantees at least the same level of protection as the existing Community legislation.

4. Member States shall not be in breach of this Directive if they decide in accordance with established practices not to apply the provisions of paragraph 1, second sentence, and for that purpose the relevant provisions of paragraph 2, for a given water-use activity, where this does not compromise the purposes and the achievement of the objectives of this Directive. Member States shall report the reasons for not fully applying paragraph 1, second sentence, in the river basin management plans.


Article 10

The combined approach for point and diffuse sources

1. Member States shall ensure that all discharges referred to in paragraph 2 into surface waters are controlled according to the combined approach set out in this Article.

2. Member States shall ensure the establishment and/or implementation of:

(a) the emission controls based on best available techniques, or

(b) the relevant emission limit values, or

(c) in the case of diffuse impacts the controls including, as appropriate, best environmental practices

set out in:

- Council Directive 96/61/EC of 24 September 1996 concerning integrated pollution prevention and control(19),

3. Where a quality objective or quality standard, whether established pursuant to this Directive, in the Directives listed in Annex IX, or pursuant to any other Community legislation, requires stricter conditions than those which would result from the application of paragraph 2, more stringent emission controls shall be set accordingly.


Article 11

Programme of measures

1. Each Member State shall ensure the establishment for each river basin district, or for the part of an international river basin district within its territory, of a programme of measures, taking account of the results of the analyses required under Article 5, in order to achieve the objectives established under Article 4. Such programmes of measures may make reference to measures following from legislation adopted at national level and covering the whole of the territory of a Member State. Where appropriate, a Member State may adopt measures applicable to all river basin districts and/or the portions of international river basin districts falling within its territory.

2. Each programme of measures shall include the "basic" measures specified in paragraph 3 and, where necessary, "supplementary" measures.

3. "Basic measures" are the minimum requirements to be complied with and shall consist of:

(a) those measures required to implement Community legislation for the protection of water, including measures required under the legislation specified in Article 10 and in part A of Annex VI;

(b) measures deemed appropriate for the purposes of Article 9;

(c) measures to promote an efficient and sustainable water use in order to avoid compromising the achievement of the objectives specified in Article 4;

(d) measures to meet the requirements of Article 7, including measures to safeguard water quality in order to reduce the level of purification treatment required for the production of drinking water;

(e) controls over the abstraction of fresh surface water and groundwater, and impoundment of fresh surface water, including a register or registers of water abstractions and a requirement of prior authorisation for abstraction and impoundment. These controls shall be periodically reviewed and, where necessary, updated. Member States can exempt from these controls, abstractions or impoundments which have no significant impact on water status;

(f) controls, including a requirement for prior authorisation of artificial recharge or augmentation of groundwater bodies. The water used may be derived from any surface water or groundwater, provided that the use of the source does not compromise the achievement of the environmental objectives established for the source or the recharged or augmented body of groundwater. These controls shall be periodically reviewed and, where necessary, updated;

(g) for point source discharges liable to cause pollution, a requirement for prior regulation, such as a prohibition on the entry of pollutants into water, or for prior authorisation, or registration based on general binding rules, laying down emission controls for the pollutants concerned, including controls in accordance with Articles 10 and 16. These controls shall be periodically reviewed and, where necessary, updated;

(h) for diffuse sources liable to cause pollution, measures to prevent or control the input of pollutants. Controls may take the form of a requirement for prior regulation, such as a prohibition on the entry of pollutants into water, prior authorisation or registration based on general binding rules where such a requirement is not otherwise provided for under Community legislation. These controls shall be periodically reviewed and, where necessary, updated;

(i) for any other significant adverse impacts on the status of water identified under Article 5 and Annex II, in particular measures to ensure that the hydromorphological conditions of the bodies of water are consistent with the achievement of the required ecological status or good ecological potential for bodies of water designated as artificial or heavily modified. Controls for this purpose may take the form of a requirement for prior authorisation or registration based on general binding rules where such a requirement is not otherwise provided for under Community legislation. Such controls shall be periodically reviewed and, where necessary, updated;

(j) a prohibition of direct discharges of pollutants into groundwater subject to the following provisions:

Member States may authorise reinjection into the same aquifer of water used for geothermal purposes.

They may also authorise, specifying the conditions for:

- injection of water containing substances resulting from the operations for exploration and extraction of hydrocarbons or mining activities, and injection of water for technical reasons, into geological formations from which hydrocarbons or other substances have been extracted or into geological formations which for natural reasons are permanently unsuitable for other purposes. Such injections shall not contain substances other than those resulting from the above operations,

- reinjection of pumped groundwater from mines and quarries or associated with the construction or maintenance of civil engineering works,

- injection of natural gas or liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) for storage purposes into geological formations which for natural reasons are permanently unsuitable for other purposes,

- injection of natural gas or liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) for storage purposes into other geological formations where there is an overriding need for security of gas supply, and where the injection is such as to prevent any present or future danger of deterioration in the quality of any receiving groundwater,

- construction, civil engineering and building works and similar activities on, or in the ground which come into contact with groundwater. For these purposes, Member States may determine that such activities are to be treated as having been authorised provided that they are conducted in accordance with general binding rules developed by the Member State in respect of such activities,

- discharges of small quantities of substances for scientific purposes for characterisation, protection or remediation of water bodies limited to the amount strictly necessary for the purposes concerned

provided such discharges do not compromise the achievement of the environmental objectives established for that body of groundwater;

(k) in accordance with action taken pursuant to Article 16, measures to eliminate pollution of surface waters by those substances specified in the list of priority substances agreed pursuant to Article 16(2) and to progressively reduce pollution by other substances which would otherwise prevent Member States from achieving the objectives for the bodies of surface waters as set out in Article 4;

(l) any measures required to prevent significant losses of pollutants from technical installations, and to prevent and/or to reduce the impact of accidental pollution incidents for example as a result of floods, including through systems to detect or give warning of such events including, in the case of accidents which could not reasonably have been foreseen, all appropriate measures to reduce the risk to aquatic ecosystems.

4. "Supplementary" measures are those measures designed and implemented in addition to the basic measures, with the aim of achieving the objectives established pursuant to Article 4. Part B of Annex VI contains a non-exclusive list of such measures.

Member States may also adopt further supplementary measures in order to provide for additional protection or improvement of the waters covered by this Directive, including in implementation of the relevant international agreements referred to in Article 1.

5. Where monitoring or other data indicate that the objectives set under Article 4 for the body of water are unlikely to be achieved, the Member State shall ensure that:

- the causes of the possible failure are investigated,

- relevant permits and authorisations are examined and reviewed as appropriate,

- the monitoring programmes are reviewed and adjusted as appropriate, and

- additional measures as may be necessary in order to achieve those objectives are established, including, as appropriate, the establishment of stricter environmental quality standards following the procedures laid down in Annex V.

Where those causes are the result of circumstances of natural cause or force majeure which are exceptional and could not reasonably have been foreseen, in particular extreme floods and prolonged droughts, the Member State may determine that additional measures are not practicable, subject to Article 4(6).

6. In implementing measures pursuant to paragraph 3, Member States shall take all appropriate steps not to increase pollution of marine waters. Without prejudice to existing legislation, the application of measures taken pursuant to paragraph 3 may on no account lead, either directly or indirectly to increased pollution of surface waters. This requirement shall not apply where it would result in increased pollution of the environment as a whole.

7. The programmes of measures shall be established at the latest nine years after the date of entry into force of this Directive and all the measures shall be made operational at the latest 12 years after that date.

8. The programmes of measures shall be reviewed, and if necessary updated at the latest 15 years after the date of entry into force of this Directive and every six years thereafter. Any new or revised measures established under an updated programme shall be made operational within three years of their establishment.


Article 12

Issues which can not be dealt with at Member State level

1. Where a Member State identifies an issue which has an impact on the management of its water but cannot be resolved by that Member State, it may report the issue to the Commission and any other Member State concerned and may make recommendations for the resolution of it.

2. The Commission shall respond to any report or recommendations from Member States within a period of six months.


Article 13

River basin management plans

1. Member States shall ensure that a river basin management plan is produced for each river basin district lying entirely within their territory.

2. In the case of an international river basin district falling entirely within the Community, Member States shall ensure coordination with the aim of producing a single international river basin management plan. Where such an international river basin management plan is not produced, Member States shall produce river basin management plans covering at least those parts of the international river basin district falling within their territory to achieve the objectives of this Directive.

3. In the case of an international river basin district extending beyond the boundaries of the Community, Member States shall endeavour to produce a single river basin management plan, and, where this is not possible, the plan shall at least cover the portion of the international river basin district lying within the territory of the Member State concerned.

4. The river basin management plan shall include the information detailed in Annex VII.

5. River basin management plans may be supplemented by the production of more detailed programmes and management plans for sub-basin, sector, issue, or water type, to deal with particular aspects of water management. Implementation of these measures shall not exempt Member States from any of their obligations under the rest of this Directive.

6. River basin management plans shall be published at the latest nine years after the date of entry into force of this Directive.

7. River basin management plans shall be reviewed and updated at the latest 15 years after the date of entry into force of this Directive and every six years thereafter.

Article 16

Strategies against pollution of water

1. The European Parliament and the Council shall adopt specific measures against pollution of water by individual pollutants or groups of pollutants presenting a significant risk to or via the aquatic environment, including such risks to waters used for the abstraction of drinking water. For those pollutants measures shall be aimed at the progressive reduction and, for priority hazardous substances, as defined in Article 2(30), at the cessation or phasing-out of discharges, emissions and losses. Such measures shall be adopted acting on the proposals presented by the Commission in accordance with the procedures laid down in the Treaty.

2. The Commission shall submit a proposal setting out a list of priority substances selected amongst those which present a significant risk to or via the aquatic environment. Substances shall be prioritised for action on the basis of risk to or via the aquatic environment, identified by:

(a) risk assessment carried out under Council Regulation (EEC) No 793/93(22), Council Directive 91/414/EEC(23), and Directive 98/8/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council(24), or

(b) targeted risk-based assessment (following the methodology of Regulation (EEC) No 793/93) focusing solely on aquatic ecotoxicity and on human toxicity via the aquatic environment.

When necessary in order to meet the timetable laid down in paragraph 4, substances shall be prioritised for action on the basis of risk to, or via the aquatic environment, identified by a simplified risk-based assessment procedure based on scientific principles taking particular account of:

- evidence regarding the intrinsic hazard of the substance concerned, and in particular its aquatic ecotoxicity and human toxicity via aquatic exposure routes, and

- evidence from monitoring of widespread environmental contamination, and

- other proven factors which may indicate the possibility of widespread environmental contamination, such as production or use volume of the substance concerned, and use patterns.

3. The Commission''s proposal shall also identify the priority hazardous substances. In doing so, the Commission shall take into account the selection of substances of concern undertaken in the relevant Community legislation regarding hazardous substances or relevant international agreements.

4. The Commission shall review the adopted list of priority substances at the latest four years after the date of entry into force of this Directive and at least every four years thereafter, and come forward with proposals as appropriate.

5. In preparing its proposal, the Commission shall take account of recommendations from the Scientific Committee on Toxicity, Ecotoxicity and the Environment, Member States, the European Parliament, the European Environment Agency, Community research programmes, international organisations to which the Community is a party, European business organisations including those representing small and medium-sized enterprises, European environmental organisations, and of other relevant information which comes to its attention.

6. For the priority substances, the Commission shall submit proposals of controls for:

- the progressive reduction of discharges, emissions and losses of the substances concerned, and, in particular

- the cessation or phasing-out of discharges, emissions and losses of the substances as identified in accordance with paragraph 3, including an appropriate timetable for doing so. The timetable shall not exceed 20 years after the adoption of these proposals by the European Parliament and the Council in accordance with the provisions of this Article.

In doing so it shall identify the appropriate cost-effective and proportionate level and combination of product and process controls for both point and diffuse sources and take account of Community-wide uniform emission limit values for process controls. Where appropriate, action at Community level for process controls may be established on a sector-by-sector basis. Where product controls include a review of the relevant authorisations issued under Directive 91/414/EEC and Directive 98/8/EC, such reviews shall be carried out in accordance with the provisions of those Directives. Each proposal for controls shall specify arrangements for their review, updating and for assessment of their effectiveness.

7. The Commission shall submit proposals for quality standards applicable to the concentrations of the priority substances in surface water, sediments or biota.

8. The Commission shall submit proposals, in accordance with paragraphs 6 and 7, and at least for emission controls for point sources and environmental quality standards within two years of the inclusion of the substance concerned on the list of priority substances. For substances included in the first list of priority substances, in the absence of agreement at Community level six years after the date of entry into force of this Directive, Member States shall establish environmental quality standards for these substances for all surface waters affected by discharges of those substances, and controls on the principal sources of such discharges, based, inter alia, on consideration of all technical reduction options. For substances subsequently included in the list of priority substances, in the absence of agreement at Community level, Member States shall take such action five years after the date of inclusion in the list.

9. The Commission may prepare strategies against pollution of water by any other pollutants or groups of pollutants, including any pollution which occurs as a result of accidents.

10. In preparing its proposals under paragraphs 6 and 7, the Commission shall also review all the Directives listed in Annex IX. It shall propose, by the deadline in paragraph 8, a revision of the controls in Annex IX for all those substances which are included in the list of priority substances and shall propose the appropriate measures including the possible repeal of the controls under Annex IX for all other substances.

All the controls in Annex IX for which revisions are proposed shall be repealed by the date of entry into force of those revisions.

11. The list of priority substances of substances mentioned in paragraphs 2 and 3 proposed by the Commission shall, on its adoption by the European Parliament and the Council, become Annex X to this Directive. Its revision mentioned in paragraph 4 shall follow the same procedure.


Article 17

Strategies to prevent and control pollution of groundwater

1. The European Parliament and the Council shall adopt specific measures to prevent and control groundwater pollution. Such measures shall be aimed at achieving the objective of good groundwater chemical status in accordance with Article 4(1)(b) and shall be adopted, acting on the proposal presented within two years after the entry into force of this Directive, by the Commission in accordance with the procedures laid down in the Treaty.

2. In proposing measures the Commission shall have regard to the analysis carried out according to Article 5 and Annex II. Such measures shall be proposed earlier if data are available and shall include:

(a) criteria for assessing good groundwater chemical status, in accordance with Annex II.2.2 and Annex V 2.3.2 and 2.4.5;

(b) criteria for the identification of significant and sustained upward trends and for the definition of starting points for trend reversals to be used in accordance with Annex V 2.4.4.

3. Measures resulting from the application of paragraph 1 shall be included in the programmes of measures required under Article 11.

4. In the absence of criteria adopted under paragraph 2 at Community level, Member States shall establish appropriate criteria at the latest five years after the date of entry into force of this Directive.

5. In the absence of criteria adopted under paragraph 4 at national level, trend reversal shall take as its starting point a maximum of 75 % of the level of the quality standards set out in existing Community legislation applicable to groundwater.

ANNEX II


1 SURFACE WATERS

1.1. Characterisation of surface water body types

Member States shall identify the location and boundaries of bodies of surface water and shall carry out an initial characterisation of all such bodies in accordance with the following methodology. Member States may group surface water bodies together for the purposes of this initial characterisation.

(i) The surface water bodies within the river basin district shall be identified as falling within either one of the following surface water categories - rivers, lakes, transitional waters or coastal waters - or as artificial surface water bodies or heavily modified surface water bodies.

(ii) For each surface water category, the relevant surface water bodies within the river basin district shall be differentiated according to type. These types are those defined using either "system A" or "system B" identified in section 1.2.

(iii) If system A is used, the surface water bodies within the river basin district shall first be differentiated by the relevant ecoregions in accordance with the geographical areas identified in section 1.2 and shown on the relevant map in Annex XI. The water bodies within each ecoregion shall then be differentiated by surface water body types according to the descriptors set out in the tables for system A.

(iv) If system B is used, Member States must achieve at least the same degree of differentiation as would be achieved using system A. Accordingly, the surface water bodies within the river basin district shall be differentiated into types using the values for the obligatory descriptors and such optional descriptors, or combinations of descriptors, as are required to ensure that type specific biological reference conditions can be reliably derived.

(v) For artificial and heavily modified surface water bodies the differentiation shall be undertaken in accordance with the descriptors for whichever of the surface water categories most closely resembles the heavily modified or artificial water body concerned.

(vi) Member States shall submit to the Commission a map or maps (in a GIS format) of the geographical location of the types consistent with the degree of differentiation required under system A.

1.3. Establishment of type-specific reference conditions for surface water body types

(i) For each surface water body type characterised in accordance with section 1.1, type-specific hydromorphological and physicochemical conditions shall be established representing the values of the hydromorphological and physicochemical quality elements specified in point 1.1 in Annex V for that surface water body type at high ecological status as defined in the relevant table in point 1.2 in Annex V. Type-specific biological reference conditions shall be established, representing the values of the biological quality elements specified in point 1.1 in Annex V for that surface water body type at high ecological status as defined in the relevant table in section 1.2 in Annex V.

(ii) In applying the procedures set out in this section to heavily modified or artificial surface water bodies references to high ecological status shall be construed as references to maximum ecological potential as defined in table 1.2.5 of Annex V. The values for maximum ecological potential for a water body shall be reviewed every six years.

(iii) Type-specific conditions for the purposes of points (i) and (ii) and type-specific biological reference conditions may be either spatially based or based on modelling, or may be derived using a combination of these methods. Where it is not possible to use these methods, Member States may use expert judgement to establish such conditions. In defining high ecological status in respect of concentrations of specific synthetic pollutants, the detection limits are those which can be achieved in accordance with the available techniques at the time when the type-specific conditions are to be established.

(iv) For spatially based type-specific biological reference conditions, Member States shall develop a reference network for each surface water body type. The network shall contain a sufficient number of sites of high status to provide a sufficient level of confidence about the values for the reference conditions, given the variability in the values of the quality elements corresponding to high ecological status for that surface water body type and the modelling techniques which are to be applied under paragraph (v).

(v) Type-specific biological reference conditions based on modelling may be derived using either predictive models or hindcasting methods. The methods shall use historical, palaeological and other available data and shall provide a sufficient level of confidence about the values for the reference conditions to ensure that the conditions so derived are consistent and valid for each surface water body type.

(vi) Where it is not possible to establish reliable type-specific reference conditions for a quality element in a surface water body type due to high degrees of natural variability in that element, not just as a result of seasonal variations, then that element may be excluded from the assessment of ecological status for that surface water type. In such circumstances Member States shall state the reasons for this exclusion in the river basin management plan.

1.4. Identification of Pressures

Member States shall collect and maintain information on the type and magnitude of the significant anthropogenic pressures to which the surface water bodies in each river basin district are liable to be subject, in particular the following.

Estimation and identification of significant point source pollution, in particular by substances listed in Annex VIII, from urban, industrial, agricultural and other installations and activities, based, inter alia, on information gathered under:

(i) Articles 15 and 17 of Directive 91/271/EEC;

(ii) Articles 9 and 15 of Directive 96/61/EC(1);

and for the purposes of the initial river basin management plan:

(iii) Article 11 of Directive 76/464/EEC; and

(iv) Directives 75/440/EC, 76/160/EEC(2), 78/659/EEC and 79/923/EEC(3).

Estimation and identification of significant diffuse source pollution, in particular by substances listed in Annex VIII, from urban, industrial, agricultural and other installations and activities; based, inter alia, on information gathered under:

(i) Articles 3, 5 and 6 of Directive 91/676/EEC(4);

(ii) Articles 7 and 17 of Directive 91/414/EEC;

(iii) Directive 98/8/EC;

and for the purposes of the first river basin management plan:

(iv) Directives 75/440/EEC, 76/160/EEC, 76/464/EEC, 78/659/EEC and 79/923/EEC.

Estimation and identification of significant water abstraction for urban, industrial, agricultural and other uses, including seasonal variations and total annual demand, and of loss of water in distribution systems.

Estimation and identification of the impact of significant water flow regulation, including water transfer and diversion, on overall flow characteristics and water balances.

Identification of significant morphological alterations to water bodies.

Estimation and identification of other significant anthropogenic impacts on the status of surface waters.

Estimation of land use patterns, including identification of the main urban, industrial and agricultural areas and, where relevant, fisheries and forests.

1.5. Assessment of Impact

Member States shall carry out an assessment of the susceptibility of the surface water status of bodies to the pressures identified above.

Member States shall use the information collected above, and any other relevant information including existing environmental monitoring data, to carry out an assessment of the likelihood that surface waters bodies within the river basin district will fail to meet the environmental quality objectives set for the bodies under Article 4. Member States may utilise modelling techniques to assist in such an assessment.

For those bodies identified as being at risk of failing the environmental quality objectives, further characterisation shall, where relevant, be carried out to optimise the design of both the monitoring programmes required under Article 8, and the programmes of measures required under Article 11.

2. GROUNDWATERS

2.1. Initial characterisation

Member States shall carry out an initial characterisation of all groundwater bodies to assess their uses and the degree to which they are at risk of failing to meet the objectives for each groundwater body under Article 4. Member States may group groundwater bodies together for the purposes of this initial characterisation. This analysis may employ existing hydrological, geological, pedological, land use, discharge, abstraction and other data but shall identify:

- the location and boundaries of the groundwater body or bodies,

- the pressures to which the groundwater body or bodies are liable to be subject including:

- diffuse sources of pollution

- point sources of pollution

- abstraction

- artificial recharge,

- the general character of the overlying strata in the catchment area from which the groundwater body receives its recharge,

- those groundwater bodies for which there are directly dependent surface water ecosystems or terrestrial ecosystems.

2.2. Further characterisation

Following this initial characterisation, Member States shall carry out further characterisation of those groundwater bodies or groups of bodies which have been identified as being at risk in order to establish a more precise assessment of the significance of such risk and identification of any measures to be required under Article 11. Accordingly, this characterisation shall include relevant information on the impact of human activity and, where relevant, information on:

- geological characteristics of the groundwater body including the extent and type of geological units,

- hydrogeological characteristics of the groundwater body including hydraulic conductivity, porosity and confinement,

- characteristics of the superficial deposits and soils in the catchment from which the groundwater body receives its recharge, including the thickness, porosity, hydraulic conductivity, and absorptive properties of the deposits and soils,

- stratification characteristics of the groundwater within the groundwater body,

- an inventory of associated surface systems, including terrestrial ecosystems and bodies of surface water, with which the groundwater body is dynamically linked,

- estimates of the directions and rates of exchange of water between the groundwater body and associated surface systems,

- sufficient data to calculate the long term annual average rate of overall recharge,

- characterisation of the chemical composition of the groundwater, including specification of the contributions from human activity. Member States may use typologies for groundwater characterisation when establishing natural background levels for these bodies of groundwater.

2.3. Review of the impact of human activity on groundwaters

For those bodies of groundwater which cross the boundary between two or more Member States or are identified following the initial characterisation undertaken in accordance with paragraph 2.1 as being at risk of failing to meet the objectives set for each body under Article 4, the following information shall, where relevant, be collected and maintained for each groundwater body:

(a) the location of points in the groundwater body used for the abstraction of water with the exception of:

- points for the abstraction of water providing less than an average of 10 m3 per day, or,

- points for the abstraction of water intended for human consumption providing less than an average of 10 m3 per day or serving less than 50 persons,

(b) the annual average rates of abstraction from such points,

(c) the chemical composition of water abstracted from the groundwater body,

(d) the location of points in the groundwater body into which water is directly discharged,

(e) the rates of discharge at such points,

(f) the chemical composition of discharges to the groundwater body, and

1.2.6. Procedure for the setting of chemical quality standards by Member States

In deriving environmental quality standards for pollutants listed in points 1 to 9 of Annex VIII for the protection of aquatic biota, Member States shall act in accordance with the following provisions. Standards may be set for water, sediment or biota.

Where possible, both acute and chronic data shall be obtained for the taxa set out below which are relevant for the water body type concerned as well as any other aquatic taxa for which data are available. The "base set" of taxa are:

- algae and/or macrophytes

- daphnia or representative organisms for saline waters

- fish.

Setting the environmental quality standard

The following procedure applies to the setting of a maximum annual average concentration:

(i) Member States shall set appropriate safety factors in each case consistent with the nature and quality of the available data and the guidance given in section 3.3.1 of Part II of "Technical guidance document in support of Commission Directive 93/67/EEC on risk assessment for new notified substances and Commission Regulation (EC) No 1488/94 on risk assessment for existing substances" and the safety factors set out in the table below:

>TABLE>

(ii) where data on persistence and bioaccumulation are available, these shall be taken into account in deriving the final value of the environmental quality standard;

(iii) the standard thus derived should be compared with any evidence from field studies. Where anomalies appear, the derivation shall be reviewed to allow a more precise safety factor to be calculated;

(iv) the standard derived shall be subject to peer review and public consultation including to allow a more precise safety factor to be calculated.

1.3. Monitoring of ecological status and chemical status for surface waters

The surface water monitoring network shall be established in accordance with the requirements of Article 8. The monitoring network shall be designed so as to provide a coherent and comprehensive overview of ecological and chemical status within each river basin and shall permit classification of water bodies into five classes consistent with the normative definitions in section 1.2. Member States shall provide a map or maps showing the surface water monitoring network in the river basin management plan.

On the basis of the characterisation and impact assessment carried out in accordance with Article 5 and Annex II, Member States shall for each period to which a river basin management plan applies, establish a surveillance monitoring programme and an operational monitoring programme. Member States may also need in some cases to establish programmes of investigative monitoring.

Member States shall monitor parameters which are indicative of the status of each relevant quality element. In selecting parameters for biological quality elements Member States shall identify the appropriate taxonomic level required to achieve adequate confidence and precision in the classification of the quality elements. Estimates of the level of confidence and precision of the results provided by the monitoring programmes shall be given in the plan.

1.3.1. Design of surveillance monitoring

Objective

Member States shall establish surveillance monitoring programmes to provide information for:

- supplementing and validating the impact assessment procedure detailed in Annex II,

- the efficient and effective design of future monitoring programmes,

- the assessment of long-term changes in natural conditions, and

- the assessment of long-term changes resulting from widespread anthropogenic activity.

The results of such monitoring shall be reviewed and used, in combination with the impact assessment procedure described in Annex II, to determine requirements for monitoring programmes in the current and subsequent river basin management plans.

Selection of monitoring points

Surveillance monitoring shall be carried out of sufficient surface water bodies to provide an assessment of the overall surface water status within each catchment or subcatchments within the river basin district. In selecting these bodies Member States shall ensure that, where appropriate, monitoring is carried out at points where:

- the rate of water flow is significant within the river basin district as a whole; including points on large rivers where the catchment area is greater than 2500 km2,

- the volume of water present is significant within the river basin district, including large lakes and reservoirs,

- significant bodies of water cross a Member State boundary,

- sites are identified under the Information Exchange Decision 77/795/EEC, and

at such other sites as are required to estimate the pollutant load which is transferred across Member State boundaries, and which is transferred into the marine environment.

Selection of quality elements

Surveillance monitoring shall be carried out for each monitoring site for a period of one year during the period covered by a river basin management plan for:

- parameters indicative of all biological quality elements,

- parameters indicative of all hydromorphological quality elements,

- parameters indicative of all general physico-chemical quality elements,

- priority list pollutants which are discharged into the river basin or sub-basin, and

- other pollutants discharged in significant quantities in the river basin or sub-basin,

unless the previous surveillance monitoring exercise showed that the body concerned reached good status and there is no evidence from the review of impact of human activity in Annex II that the impacts on the body have changed. In these cases, surveillance monitoring shall be carried out once every three river basin management plans.

1.3.2. Design of operational monitoring

Operational monitoring shall be undertaken in order to:

- establish the status of those bodies identified as being at risk of failing to meet their environmental objectives, and

- assess any changes in the status of such bodies resulting from the programmes of measures.

The programme may be amended during the period of the river basin management plan in the light of information obtained as part of the requirements of Annex II or as part of this Annex, in particular to allow a reduction in frequency where an impact is found not to be significant or the relevant pressure is removed.

Selection of monitoring sites

Operational monitoring shall be carried out for all those bodies of water which on the basis of either the impact assessment carried out in accordance with Annex II or surveillance monitoring are identified as being at risk of failing to meet their environmental objectives under Article 4 and for those bodies of water into which priority list substances are discharged. Monitoring points shall be selected for priority list substances as specified in the legislation laying down the relevant environmental quality standard. In all other cases, including for priority list substances where no specific guidance is given in such legislation, monitoring points shall be selected as follows:

- for bodies at risk from significant point source pressures, sufficient monitoring points within each body in order to assess the magnitude and impact of the point source. Where a body is subject to a number of point source pressures monitoring points may be selected to assess the magnitude and impact of these pressures as a whole,

- for bodies at risk from significant diffuse source pressures, sufficient monitoring points within a selection of the bodies in order to assess the magnitude and impact of the diffuse source pressures. The selection of bodies shall be made such that they are representative of the relative risks of the occurrence of the diffuse source pressures, and of the relative risks of the failure to achieve good surface water status,

- for bodies at risk from significant hydromorphological pressure, sufficient monitoring points within a selection of the bodies in order to assess the magnitude and impact of the hydromorphological pressures. The selection of bodies shall be indicative of the overall impact of the hydromorphological pressure to which all the bodies are subject.

Selection of quality elements

In order to assess the magnitude of the pressure to which bodies of surface water are subject Member States shall monitor for those quality elements which are indicative of the pressures to which the body or bodies are subject. In order to assess the impact of these pressures, Member States shall monitor as relevant:

- parameters indicative of the biological quality element, or elements, most sensitive to the pressures to which the water bodies are subject,

- all priority substances discharged, and other pollutants discharged in significant quantities,

- parameters indicative of the hydromorphological quality element most sensitive to the pressure identified.

1.3.3. Design of investigative monitoring

Objective

Investigative monitoring shall be carried out:

- where the reason for any exceedances is unknown,

- where surveillance monitoring indicates that the objectives set out in Article 4 for a body of water are not likely to be achieved and operational monitoring has not already been established, in order to ascertain the causes of a water body or water bodies failing to achieve the environmental objectives, or

- to ascertain the magnitude and impacts of accidental pollution,

and shall inform the establishment of a programme of measures for the achievement of the environmental objectives and specific measures necessary to remedy the effects of accidental pollution.

1.3.4. Frequency of monitoring

For the surveillance monitoring period, the frequencies for monitoring parameters indicative of physico-chemical quality elements given below should be applied unless greater intervals would be justified on the basis of technical knowledge and expert judgement. For biological or hydromorphological quality elements monitoring shall be carried out at least once during the surveillance monitoring period.

For operational monitoring, the frequency of monitoring required for any parameter shall be determined by Member States so as to provide sufficient data for a reliable assessment of the status of the relevant quality element. As a guideline, monitoring should take place at intervals not exceeding those shown in the table below unless greater intervals would be justified on the basis of technical knowledge and expert judgement.

Frequencies shall be chosen so as to achieve an acceptable level of confidence and precision. Estimates of the confidence and precision attained by the monitoring system used shall be stated in the river basin management plan.

Monitoring frequencies shall be selected which take account of the variability in parameters resulting from both natural and anthropogenic conditions. The times at which monitoring is undertaken shall be selected so as to minimise the impact of seasonal variation on the results, and thus ensure that the results reflect changes in the water body as a result of changes due to anthropogenic pressure. Additional monitoring during different seasons of the same year shall be carried out, where necessary, to achieve this objective.

>TABLE>

1.3.5. Additional monitoring requirements for protected areas

The monitoring programmes required above shall be supplemented in order to fulfil the following requirements:

Drinking water abstraction points

Bodies of surface water designated in Article 7 which provide more than 100 m3 a day as an average shall be designated as monitoring sites and shall be subject to such additional monitoring as may be necessary to meet the requirements of that Article. Such bodies shall be monitored for all priority substances discharged and all other substances discharged in significant quantities which could affect the status of the body of water and which are controlled under the provisions of the Drinking Water Directive. Monitoring shall be carried out in accordance with the frequencies set out below:

>TABLE>

Habitat and species protection areas

Bodies of water forming these areas shall be included within the operational monitoring programme referred to above where, on the basis of the impact assessment and the surveillance monitoring, they are identified as being at risk of failing to meet their environmental objectives under Article 4. Monitoring shall be carried out to assess the magnitude and impact of all relevant significant pressures on these bodies and, where necessary, to assess changes in the status of such bodies resulting from the programmes of measures. Monitoring shall continue until the areas satisfy the water-related requirements of the legislation under which they are designated and meet their objectives under Article 4.

1.3.6. Standards for monitoring of quality elements

Methods used for the monitoring of type parameters shall conform to the international standards listed below or such other national or international standards which will ensure the provision of data of an equivalent scientific quality and comparability.

Macroinvertebrate sampling

1.4. Classification and presentation of ecological status

1.4.1. Comparability of biological monitoring results

(i) Member States shall establish monitoring systems for the purpose of estimating the values of the biological quality elements specified for each surface water category or for heavily modified and artificial bodies of surface water. In applying the procedure set out below to heavily modified or artificial water bodies, references to ecological status should be construed as references to ecological potential. Such systems may utilise particular species or groups of species which are representative of the quality element as a whole.

(ii) In order to ensure comparability of such monitoring systems, the results of the systems operated by each Member State shall be expressed as ecological quality ratios for the purposes of classification of ecological status. These ratios shall represent the relationship between the values of the biological parameters observed for a given body of surface water and the values for these parameters in the reference conditions applicable to that body. The ratio shall be expressed as a numerical value between zero and one, with high ecological status represented by values close to one and bad ecological status by values close to zero.

(iii) Each Member State shall divide the ecological quality ratio scale for their monitoring system for each surface water category into five classes ranging from high to bad ecological status, as defined in Section 1.2, by assigning a numerical value to each of the boundaries between the classes. The value for the boundary between the classes of high and good status, and the value for the boundary between good and moderate status shall be established through the intercalibration exercise described below.

(iv) The Commission shall facilitate this intercalibration exercise in order to ensure that these class boundaries are established consistent with the normative definitions in Section 1.2 and are comparable between Member States.

(v) As part of this exercise the Commission shall facilitate an exchange of information between Members States leading to the identification of a range of sites in each ecoregion in the Community; these sites will form an intercalibration network. The network shall consist of sites selected from a range of surface water body types present within each ecoregion. For each surface water body type selected, the network shall consist of at least two sites corresponding to the boundary between the normative definitions of high and good status, and at least two sites corresponding to the boundary between the normative definitions of good and moderate status. The sites shall be selected by expert judgement based on joint inspections and all other available information.

(vi) Each Member State monitoring system shall be applied to those sites in the intercalibration network which are both in the ecoregion and of a surface water body type to which the system will be applied pursuant to the requirements of this Directive. The results of this application shall be used to set the numerical values for the relevant class boundaries in each Member State monitoring system.

(vii) Within three years of the date of entry into force of the Directive, the Commission shall prepare a draft register of sites to form the intercalibration network which may be adapted in accordance with the procedures laid down in Article 21. The final register of sites shall be established within four years of the date of entry into force of the Directive and shall be published by the Commission.

(viii) The Commission and Member States shall complete the intercalibration exercise within 18 months of the date on which the finalised register is published.

(ix) The results of the intercalibration exercise and the values established for the Member State monitoring system classifications shall be published by the Commission within six months of the completion of the intercalibration exercise.

1.4.2. Presentation of monitoring results and classification of ecological status and ecological potential

(i)

>TABLE>

(ii)

>TABLE>

(iii) Member States shall also indicate, by a black dot on the map, those bodies of water where failure to achieve good status or good ecological potential is due to non-compliance with one or more environmental quality standards which have been established for that body of water in respect of specific synthetic and non-synthetic pollutants (in accordance with the compliance regime established by the Member State).

1.4.3. Presentation of monitoring results and classification of chemical status

Where a body of water achieves compliance with all the environmental quality standards established in Annex IX, Article 16 and under other relevant Community legislation setting environmental quality standards it shall be recorded as achieving good chemical status. If not, the body shall be recorded as failing to achieve good chemical status.

The groundwater monitoring network shall be established in accordance with the requirements of Articles 7 and 8. The monitoring network shall be designed so as to provide a coherent and comprehensive overview of groundwater chemical status within each river basin and to detect the presence of long-term anthropogenically induced upward trends in pollutants.

On the basis of the characterisation and impact assessment carried out in accordance with Article 5 and Annex II, Member States shall for each period to which a river basin management plan applies, establish a surveillance monitoring programme. The results of this programme shall be used to establish an operational monitoring programme to be applied for the remaining period of the plan.

Estimates of the level of confidence and precision of the results provided by the monitoring programmes shall be given in the plan.

2.4.2. Surveillance monitoring

Objective

Surveillance monitoring shall be carried out in order to:

- supplement and validate the impact assessment procedure,

- provide information for use in the assessment of long term trends both as a result of changes in natural conditions and through anthropogenic activity.

Selection of monitoring sites

Sufficient monitoring sites shall be selected for each of the following:

- bodies identified as being at risk following the characterisation exercise undertaken in accordance with Annex II,

- bodies which cross a Member State boundary.

Selection of parameters

The following set of core parameters shall be monitored in all the selected groundwater bodies:

- oxygen content

- pH value

- conductivity

- nitrate

- ammonium

Bodies which are identified in accordance with Annex II as being at significant risk of failing to achieve good status shall also be monitored for those parameters which are indicative of the impact of these pressures.

Transboundary water bodies shall also be monitored for those parameters which are relevant for the protection of all of the uses supported by the groundwater flow.

2.4.3. Operational monitoring

Objective

Operational monitoring shall be undertaken in the periods between surveillance monitoring programmes in order to:

- establish the chemical status of all groundwater bodies or groups of bodies determined as being at risk,

- establish the presence of any long term anthropogenically induced upward trend in the concentration of any pollutant.

Selection of monitoring sites

Operational monitoring shall be carried out for all those groundwater bodies or groups of bodies which on the basis of both the impact assessment carried out in accordance with Annex II and surveillance monitoring are identified as being at risk of failing to meet objectives under Article 4. The selection of monitoring sites shall also reflect an assessment of how representative monitoring data from that site is of the quality of the relevant groundwater body or bodies.

Frequency of monitoring

Operational monitoring shall be carried out for the periods between surveillance monitoring programmes at a frequency sufficient to detect the impacts of relevant pressures but at a minimum of once per annum.

2.4.4. Identification of trends in pollutants

Member States shall use data from both surveillance and operational monitoring in the identification of long term anthropogenically induced upward trends in pollutant concentrations and the reversal of such trends. The base year or period from which trend identification is to be calculated shall be identified. The calculation of trends shall be undertaken for a body or, where appropriate, group of bodies of groundwater. Reversal of a trend shall be demonstrated statistically and the level of confidence associated with the identification stated.

2.4.5. Interpretation and presentation of groundwater chemical status

In assessing status, the results of individual monitoring points within a groundwater body shall be aggregated for the body as a whole. Without prejudice to the Directives concerned, for good status to be achieved for a groundwater body, for those chemical parameters for which environmental quality standards have been set in Community legislation:

- the mean value of the results of monitoring at each point in the groundwater body or group of bodies shall be calculated, and

- in accordance with Article 17 these mean values shall be used to demonstrate compliance with good groundwater chemical status.

Subject to point 2.5, Member States shall provide a map of groundwater chemical status, colour-coded as indicated below:

Good: green

Poor: red

Member States shall also indicate by a black dot on the map, those groundwater bodies which are subject to a significant and sustained upward trend in the concentrations of any pollutant resulting from the impact of human activity. Reversal of a trend shall be indicated by a blue dot on the map.

These maps shall be included in the river basin management plan.

2.5. Presentation of Groundwater Status

Member States shall provide in the river basin management plan a map showing for each groundwater body or groups of groundwater bodies both the quantitative status and the chemical status of that body or group of bodies, colour-coded in accordance with the requirements of points 2.2.4 and 2.4.5. Member States may choose not to provide separate maps under points 2.2.4 and 2.4.5 but shall in that case also provide an indication in accordance with the requirements of point 2.4.5 on the map required under this point, of those bodies which are subject to a significant and sustained upward trend in the concentration of any pollutant or any reversal in such a trend.

The solution is found identifying existing good practices within the partnership and from there jointly developing integrated master plans focused on the development of NEW lakes and wetland areas which both significantly increase water quality in the water system and make the water system more flexible in terms of quantity. At the end of the project, relevant regional policies within the partnership will be evaluated in order to promote future lake and wetland development. The conclusions will become the basis of policy recommendations and a toolkit for lake and wetland development. The implementation of the master plans is envisaged beyond the project’s lifetime and will be facilitated by the development of action and funding plans.

Key Approaches					                					Ecosystems based approachTechnical                    									3. Experiences that can be exchanged									Water leakage control from supply pipelines has been developed to become a strategically important component for water resource management. It has been used to reach an optimum economic balance between water supply and water demand. The case is particularly relevant for many coastal areas of the Mediterranean which face water shortages. The gap between supply and demand is likely to get bigger as the effects of climate change become more pronounced in the coming decades as the Mediterranean region is predicted to become both hotter and drier.									4. Overview of the case									In Malta, extreme water shortage has led to integrated water resource management being used to improve water supply. With limited options to either decrease demand or increase supply without large-scale, expensive solutions, the problem of water leakage has been tackled. A process has been set up whereby water lost to leakage has been reduced by 50% eliminating the need for expensive desalination plants along the coast.									5. Context and Objectives									a) Context									The Maltese archipelago consists of 6 islands and islets, the main islands being Malta, Gozo and Comino. The total surface area is approximately 316 km2. The Islands have a population of approximately 376,000. Water is a scarce resource, particularly in view of the local hydro-climatological conditions, including the low rainfall and high evaporation and transpiration, relatively long dry season, small surface area, the irregular topographic relief and the characteristics of the local aquifers. The Maltese islands, like other parts of the Mediterranean region, is an area of acute water shortage. Malta not only faces shortages of water but also has only limited groundwater (exacerbated by illegal abstraction in the agricultural sector). Increased use of groundwater is therefore not an option for municipal water supply and there is little potential for reduction on the demand side. Malta has the lowest water resources index (at 40 m3/year/capita) and the highest water competition index (24,800 inhabitant/hm3/year) in comparison with other countries from the Mediterranean basin. Six reverse osmosis plants have been built locally, supplying 50% of needs. However, this water is expensive. Leakage management therefore became to be seen as an important contributor to balancing supply and demand, and the prime aims of reducing production costs, improving the economies of the water supply organisation, and postponing capital investments in water network renewal. The challenge has been considerable: the total length of water mains below ground, excluding consumer services, is around 2,000 km and the total number of water services is at around 200,000 km.									b) Objectives									To improve water supply as part of an integrated water resource management strategy and reduce the investment cost of coastal dependent, sea-water desalination plants.									6. Implementation of the ICZM Approach (i.e. management, tools, resources)									a) Management									The Water Services Corporation (WSC) is the corporate body in charge of water management in Malta. In February 2001 the WSC handed over its regulatory responsibilities to the newly set-up Malta Resources Authority (MRA). For the achievement of the defined objectives, teams from the University of Malta, the International Water Association and the Malta Institute of Water Technology participated with specific roles.									b) ICZM tools									Leakage control in the Maltese Islands is more than just capital investment into modern technology; it is an exercise in proper strategic management at a corporate level as part of an integrated water resource management programme. An innovative economic leakage intervention model has been developed. This model is designed to act as a tactical planning tool focused towards daily resource utilization and tactical planning decisions with one objective: guiding the practitioner towards reaching the long-range goals and targets of the Corporation as quickly and economically as possible. Additionally, an Integrated Water Management System has been developed. This is essentially an information system that utilizes a data model and a geographical information system which is used primarily as a mid to high-level decision-making and decision-assisting tool. 									7. Cost and resources									No costs are available.									8. Effectiveness (i.e. were the foreseen goals/objectives of the work reached?)									The Water Services Corporation was able to more than halve its national leakage within 5 years; from 2,800 to 1,200 m3/m, as well as achieving  an internationally recognized water saving target for Gozo. This has been achieved despite the technical difficulties of a dense and complex water network. Whilst it is difficult to compute the true savings that a leakage reduction brings about, an audited accounting exercise was carried out in 2001. The accumulated marginal cost of water saved was computed to be in excess of €37 million over a 20-year period. The calculation was considered a conservative one.									9. Success and Fail factors									Despite severe technical difficulties, leakage reduction has played a significant role in minimising dependence on (high cost) water supply from desalination.  To be effective, leakage control should be seen as a major component of a strategy for water resource management, involving sophisticated management techniques as well as technical innovation. Interaction with other institutions is important. The performance of the staff is critical to success. The teams from the different participating institutions have been developed into self directed work teams, setting their own targets in line with the more broad master-targets. This teamwork approach has been found to be most effective although it has taken time to build capacity. The engineers themselves are held fully accountable for results obtained and the achieving of targets. Strategic planning with long, medium and short-range targets are also seen as important. The new detection programme to cut leaks from the supply mains is now helping the WSC to focus on better water quality rather than quantity.									10. Unforeseen outcomes									11.

The most up-to-date regional climate scenarios, and existing catchment and lake models were used in CLIME to address issues that are central to the implementation of the Water Framework Directive. CLIME took advantage of automatic water quality monitoring systems already deployed on many of our target lakes. CLIME had a socio-economic component which paid particular attention to two water quality issues that are likely to become increasingly important:
   1. Leaching of highly coloured water from peatland catchments.
   2. Increased productivity of some lakes and the increasing frequency of algal blooms. CLIME also had a decision support component which developed an integrated climate - catchment - lake - socio-economy tool with a graphical interface and uncertainty analysis capability. The development of this CLIME DSS tool continues.
Also, in a related prject with JRC, a method and a website for illustrating the impacts of climate change on physical characteristics of lakes in Europe was developed.

Water Scarcity and Drought, increasingly caused by climate change effects, will affect the European Union on ecological, on economic as well as a on social issues. These impacts will affect the citizens of the European Union in particular on local and regional level. Strategies on regional policy level are required, in order to mitigate these climate change effects.  The project will result in a digital exchange platform, a good practice handbook, a survey specifying the opportunities to exchange good practices within the partnership, regional action plans to transfer experiences between regions, an e-learning programme with thematic modules as well as policy recommendations. Special attention will be given to regions in central and eastern Europe by establishing a focal point on water scarcity and droughts in Hungary.
Water CoRe leads to improved water scarcity and drought management policies and instruments in all partner regions. Regional politicians of the partner regions have underlined their commitment to this project in a Memorandum of Understanding. Via the project homepage the results are accessible also to other European regions. Adaptive management

The influence of climate change on contaminant spreading and transfer and the resultant risk to human populations in the Arctic and other areas of Europe will be studied by:
* Research on the ways in which climate change will affect the long-range transport and fate of selected groups of contaminants, and possible implications for the re-distribution of contaminants (geographically and between relevant environmental media). This will involve modelling, utilizing the information base that exists on the distribution of such contaminants in the Arctic and other areas of Europe
* Research on the impacts that changing pathways and climatic conditions will have on contaminant uptake and transfer within food webs, leading to foods consumed by humans. This will involve experimental work, process studies and targeted analytical studies, the latter focussed on supporting the modelling work and process studies related to human exposure to contaminants.
* Research focussing on human health, aimed at determining how climate-mediated changes in the environmental fate of selected groups of contaminants will result in changes in exposure of human populations, in the Arctic and in selected areas of Europe New information about the chemical characteristics and environmental behaviour of representative contaminants in Arctic conditions. 
* Model results describing the transport of chemical contaminants from source regions to the Arctic, and their fate, including uptake in food webs, under selected climate scenarios. 
* Compilations of data and information providing an overview of exposure of Arctic populations to contaminants at the present time, and how this may change in the future due to climate change. 
* Compilations of data and results of past and current health studies of human populations in several areas of the Arctic, and their analysis with respect to the potential health impacts of contaminant exposure. 
* Comparison of information from Arctic health studies with results of studies of contaminant effects on populations in other selected areas of Europe.

Experiences that can be exchanged									Creating a flood control area which means that, in case of a storm surge, the storm tide of the estuary becomes truncated and flows over an overflow dyke into the designated area in a controlled manner.									4. Overview of the case									The creation of a controlled, reduced tide into a flood control area in an estuarine river system to provide a more sustainable form of flood management control. This innovative system allows the creation of new habitats.									5. Context and Objectives									a) Context									The Scheldt estuary is about 160 km long bordering Belgium and the Netherlands. The controlled inundation area is a low-lying old polder bordering the Scheldt just south of Antwerp. The Flood Control Area in Kruibeke is the most important flood control area of the Sigmaplan of 1977 which was designed to protect the Sea Scheldt basin against storm surges from the North Sea. Kruibeke is the last of 13 flood control areas to be built and at 580 ha is the largest flood control area of the Sigmaplan. 300 ha of the area are designated as mudflat and marshland. Twice a day, at high tide, a limited (reduced) amount of water flows into the area, mimicking the natural tidal regime to create a matching landscape. This system is unique in Europe. It is already recognised as a Birds and Habitat Directive Area. 150 ha of the site will become a Grassland Bird Area, with open grasslands and meadows. The farmers who lost their land in the polder will ensure the maintenance of the grasslands. 40 ha of Elzenbroek forest and other types of forest will be created in compensation for the forest lost by the construction of the ring dyke of the flood control area. Without the construction of the flood control area, the Kruibeke polder would have remained agricultural land without any additional value to nature or to the safety of the Scheldt estuary. The combination of a safety project with nature by using a controlled reduced tidal system is also recommended when compensation for lost mud flats and marshes is needed.									b) Objectives									The Flood Control Area in Kruibeke aims to reduce flood risk in the Seascheldt Basin, support existing habitats and heighten ecological values by creating new habitats and recreational possibilities for all.									6. Implementation of the ICZM Approach (i.e. management, tools, resources)									a) Management									The Seascheldt Department of Waterways and Seachannel NV (Waterwegen en Zeekanaal NV) has no official partners while constructing the Flood Control Area. There is, however a managing commission that monitors the creation of the nature habitats in the area. This Commission consists of the Seascheldt Department (Waterways and Seachannel), the Agency for Nature and Forest, the Kruibeke Municipality, the Farmers Guild East Flanders, Kruin – the local Nature Association, Department for Sustainable Agriculture, Department for Environment, Nature and Energy Policy, Province of East-Flanders.									b) ICZM tools									The current river dyke will be lowered by 1.5m to create an overflowing dyke. A fibred, open stone asphalt layer will protect the crest and the inner slope. In several locations the inlet and outlet sluices will be constructed to induce the controlled reduced tide or to allow de-watering of the flood control area. A high ring dyke around the flood control area will ensure the safety of the surrounding communities. This dyke ensures that the Scheldt water remains in the inundation area and does not flood the hinterland. At low tide, the water flows back to the river through outlet sluices, thus emptying the area. De-watering of the hinterland is guaranteed by the Barbierbeek stream and the northern and southern de-watering ditches. 									Scheldt water flows in and out of the tidal areas twice each day. This has a positive effect on the development of different habitats, but is not allowed to compromise safety. In case of an emergency, the flood control area must be empty to allow as big a portion of the storm surge as possible to flow into the area. A storm surge that floods the flood control area is expected on average once or twice a year. The sediment of the estuarine water is held back by the sluices to avoid silting up of the flood control ara which would reduce it’s water take-up capacity. The use of high inlet sluices creates a wide range in inundation frequencies, favouring diverse marsh ecology. These sluices also aerate the estuarine water, even functioning as a lung for the estuary.									7. Cost and resources									No costs are available.									8. Effectiveness (i.e. were the foreseen goals/objectives of the work reached?)									At this point, the inhabitants are protected against water levels with average return periods of 70 years. Once fully operational, the level of protection will increase to once in 350 years. 300 ha of mudflat and salt marsh, 150 ha of birds grasslands area and 40 ha of Elzenbroek and other types of forest have been created. Service roads running alongside all the dykes will accommodate maintenance teams and walkers alike. Slow and fast traffic (mountain bikers, horsemen, cyclists) will be separated wherever possible, amateur fishermen can also set their bait along the ditches aside the ring dyke. 									9. Success and Fail factors									The results of a social cost-benefit analysis helped public-sector bodies in taking relevant decisions. 									Stakeholder participation started too late in the process. This led to the construction of the Kruibeke site suffering severe delays due to protest actions, problems with building permits etc. By engaging stakeholders only in a later phase, a part of their trust was already lost. Giving stakeholders the opportunity to think along and to decide along constituted a major step forward in mutual relations. However, it took a long time to regain trust and get the implementation planning back on track. 									A flood protection zone near houses always causes fear, particularly as Kruibeke had no history of flooding. It is important to provide enough information and a single contact person that can reassure people involved.									10. Unforeseen outcomes									The positive impact on the water quality was greater than expected.									11. Prepared by									Alan Pickaver, Coastal &amp; Marine Union, NL									12. Verified by									 It was not possible to verify this case.									13.

Case studies in the partner countries will cover the most relevant challenges. 
 "Watersketch" endeavours to produce a blueprint, which will lead to improved river basin management in the Baltic Sea region. The project partners will take a close look at the spatial planning and implementation of the European Water Framework Directive (WFD) for selected rivers and develop strategies for sustainable use. 

The project takes economic, social and environmental aspects equally into account. The "Watersketch" results will also aid decision-making for spatial planners. A final manual and a web-based toolbox will make the results available to others. This way, efforts towards sustainable use and an improved river basin management can therefore be supported in other countries as well.

However, flash floods are locally rare and poorly-observed events. Therefore, the only way to improve our  knowledge of these phenomena is to lead the investigation at the European scale with a common strategy. This call for the organization and analysis of the existing patrimony of data concerning past European flash flood events and for the development and harmonization of an innovative European observational strategy.  Therefore, HYDRATE has the objective to improve the scientific basis of flash flood forecasting, through: 
* Analysis of past flash flood events at the European scale;
* Advancing and harmonising across Europe a common flash flood observation strategy; 
* Developing and validating a coherent set of technologies and tools for effective early warning system. To this end, the project includes actions on the organization of the existing flash flood data patrimony across Europe. The observation strategy proposed in HYDRATE has the objective to collect flash flood data by combining hydrometeorological monitoring and the acquisition of complementary information from post-event surveys. This will involve a network of existing Hydrometeorological Observatories; all placed in high flash flood potential regions. HYDRATE will develop a freely-accessible European Flash Flood Database to make available the collected hydrometeorological data to the international research community. The final aim of HYDRATE is to enhance the capability of flash flood forecasting in ungauged basins by exploiting the extended availability of flash flood data and the improved process understanding.

1. To critically review common practice in hazard and risk assessment of debris flows, rock avalanches, and snow avalanches.
2. To evaluate the sensitivity of risk as a function of varying hazards, vulnerability, and elements at risk. 
3. To discuss and quantify aspects of risk aversion. 
4. To address cause-effect relationships between Extremely Rapid Mass Movements and their off-site and long-term effects in a multi-risk approach. 
5. To develop methodological tools for an Integral Risk Management (IRM) paying equal attention to active and passive measures of prevention, intervention, and recovery. 
6. To propose IRM strategies for detecting, monitoring, and responding to Extremely Rapid Mass Movements, given the constraints of data quality, availability, and analysis, and especially given the limited allocation of technical, logistical, and financial budgets
  On the local level, building codes and hazard zonation may benefit, be revised, or appropriately reformulated on the basis of IRM principles. The importance of risk sensitivity and risk evolution through time may warrant the implementation of obligatory regular quality reviews or audits to check whether hazard and risk maps are still up-to-date, or whether the local vulnerability to Extremely Rapid Mass Movements have changed substantially. The assessment of the design lifetime of various risk-related products will be an important asset for decision-support in this matter. 
On the European level, results of the IRASMOS project may provide impulses for research focal points in sub-priorities.

Weaver 41 partners FP 6 Europe`s deep ocean margin HERMES is designed to gain new insights into the biodiversity, structure, function and dynamics of ecosystems along Europe''s deep-ocean margin. It represents the first major attempt to understand European deep-water ecosystems and their environment in an integrated way by bringing together expertise in biodiversity, geology, sedimentology, physical oceanography, microbiology and biogeochemistry, so that the generic relationship between biodiversity and ecosystem functioning can be understood. Study sites will extend from the Arctic to the Black Sea and include open slopes, where landslides and deep-ocean circulation affect ecosystem development, and biodiversity hotspots, such as cold seeps, cold-water coral mounds, canyons and anoxic environments, where the geosphere and hydrosphere influence the biosphere through escape of fluids, presence of gas hydrates and deep-water currents. These important systems require urgent study because of their possible biological fragility, unique genetic resources, global relevance to carbon cycling and possible susceptibility to global change and man-made disturbances. Past changes, including catastrophic events, will be assessed using sediment archives.  We will make estimates of the flow rates of methane from the geosphere and calculate how much is utilised by benthic communities, leaving the residual contribution to reach the atmosphere as a greenhouse gas. HERMES will enable forecasting of biodiversity change in relation to natural and man-made environmental changes by developing the first comprehensive pan-European margin Geographic Information System. This will provide a framework for integrating science, environmental modelling and socio-economic indicators in ecosystem management.

The tool will also enable stakeholders to explore adaptation strategies for reducing climate change vulnerability, discovering where, when and under what circumstances such actions may help. It will highlight the cost-effectiveness and cross-sectoral benefits and conflicts of different adaptation options and enable uncertainties to be investigated to better inform the development of robust policy responses. 
 The final output from CLIMSAVE will be the Integrated Assessment Platform which will allow stakeholders or interested citizens to analyse climate change impacts, vulnerability and adaptation options themselves. The platform will be accessible from the CLIMSAVE website and will be available from Summer 2012.

The prediction time scales of interest extend from days to months. This integrated system will be the Ocean component of the future Gmes  system.
At the core of the system is the collection, validation and assimilation of remote sensed and in situ data into ocean circulation models that allow for the self consistent merging of the data types, interpolation in time and space for uniform coverage, nowcasting (i.e. data synthesis in real-time), forecasting, and hind-casting, and delivery of information products.
The project will develop marine applications addressing the needs of both intermediate and end-users, whether institutional or from the private sector, with the objective to:
    * Improve the safety and efficiency of maritime transport and naval operations;
    * Enable the sustainable exploitation and management of ocean resources (offshore oil and gas industry, fisheries); 
    * Mitigate the effects of environmental hazards and pollution crisis (oil spills, harmful algal blooms); 
    * Contribute to ocean climate variability studies and seasonal climate prediction; 
    * Improve national security and reduce risks, 
    * Advance marine research with the aim to better understand the global climate, the ocean and its ecosystems.

Such effects will result in a lower area of suitable habitat for high alpine specialists as their optimal habitat becomes increasingly small. In addition, populations on separate high altitude areas will become increasingly fragmented and isolated from one-another as suitable habitat towards the lower end of their altitudinal range becomes unsuitable.
For many alpine specialists, mountain tops may be considered as islands separated by unsuitable habitat, and the size and spacing of these can greatly affect the regional occurrence of species. This project will determine the effects of high alpine habitat patch size and isolation on the abundance and species richness of different animal taxa (birds, butterflies and carabids, representing different dispersal abilities) by carrying out surveys in habitat patches representing a gradient of different sizes and levels of isolation, where patches are defined by the treeline and a range of high altitude species of open grassland habitats are surveyed.
Effects of fragmentation will be examined by analysing the relationship between species abundance/richness and patch size and isolation. Resulting statistical models will then be used to examine the potential consequences of climate change on alpine communities by considering differing scenarios of altitudinal shifts in vegetation zones. The project will produce predictions of the effects of habitat fragmentation and therefore enable recommendations about the size and location of any protected areas that are designated to ameliorate climate change effects.

Some of these changes have been of the order of 5-10°C in only a few decades. The cause of these changes lies in the oceanography of the North Atlantic Ocean. The Gulf Stream transports vast amounts of heat from the Tropics and releases it into Europe, maintaining a warm climate. However, this surface current has not always done this. It is now understood that in the past this current has sometimes abruptly swung to a more southerly position off the Iberian Peninsula, robbing northern Europe of heat and moisture. In this project we will explore the effect of these changes on glacier extent in the Spanish Pyrenees. Glaciers are highly sensitive to climate change, particularly to temperature. 
 We will use the cutting edge technique of exposure dating using cosmogenic nuclides to determine the position of glaciers in the past. We will then reconstruct the position of the glaciers through time to determine the response to climate change on this system. To implement this project we will use existing infrastructure at the University of Exeter to introduce a capability to prepare samples for Cl-36 dating. Climate change is one of the greatest challenges facing humanity today.

* Generic quasi-static flow models relating single turbine production and fatigue load to the map of wind speeds. A time averaged quasi-static flow model derived from fluid dynamics and based on meteorological and wind turbine related measures. 
* Dynamic flow models describing deviation from a static model due to rapidly changing flow effects. Dynamic flow models that allow predictions of the flow at all measurement locations. A modelling framework that supports online flow measurements and bridges the gap between a quasi-static flow model and individual wind turbine control. 
* Principles for supervisory farm power/load optimisation. Centralized control principles for farm level optimisation of flow resource allocation in order to meet farm level control objectives. The control principles incorporate knowledge of the wind flow variations, provide robustness by addressing reconfiguration and at the same time minimize the (extreme and fatigue) loads experienced by turbines. 
* Principles for decentralized control of the wind power and fatigue load relations. The basic approach for decentralization is to split the global design objective for the wind farm into separate utility functions for each turbine, then let the turbines cooperate by buying and selling support from each other in an on-line virtual market system.
* Case study, dissemination and exploitation.

 * Complexity. Aeolus will support a paradigm shift from single turbine control to farm level control, by investigating a centralized and a decentralized control principle. 
* New markets. Aeolus help develop the European leadership in the new market for large scale wind farms.
* Efficiency and flexibility. Aeolus provides optimal solutions to maximize power production while minimizing structural loads. Flexibility is achieved by a distributed control paradigm.
* Low-cost monitoring. Aeolus will provide new knowledge on how to generally predict dynamic flows based on monitoring of the speed and direction of the flow through a network of spatially distributed sensors.

Experiences that can be exchanged									A successful approach for sustainable and integrated coastal management, through the establishment of a local Consortium which includes municipalities, county councils, and the Regional Departments of the Generalitat of Catalonia, to elaborate action plans and specific projects. This initiative is the implementation at the local level of all the European, national and regional ICZM regulations, promoting the co-ordination and co-operation with institutional actors, scientists and social associations.									4. Overview of the case									The Consortium was created in 2006 with the aim to sustainably manage a coastal, marine and land area in the county of Garraf, following the European Recommendation on ICZM. It comprises the municipalities of Sitges, Sant Pere de Ribes, Vilanova i Cubelles; Garraf Regional Council and three departments of the Government of Catalonia: Environment and Housing, Agriculture, Food and Rural Action and Country Planning and Public Works. The basic objectives to be carried out are related to the protection and conservation of Garraf’s coastal area, the adaptation to, and mitigation of, climate change, the integration of environmental and biodiversity conservation with an economic and recreational use of the coast, and finally, institutional and citizen co-ordination. 									5. Context and Objectives									a) Context									Garraf coast is an important area in terms of ecological values: it was declared a Special Areas for Conservation (SAC), Special Protection Area for Birds (SPA) and a member of the Natura 2000 network with a wide marine area (that stretches between the  towns of Castelldefels and Cunit) and some land spaces (the area of Muntanyeta and the river Foix estuary); the Long Beach and the Ribes bank estuary are included as natural wetland areas in Catalonia; Costas Garraf is an area of special importance for food and marine bird communities of the Llobregat and Ebre Deltas and even for the Mediterranean shearwater which breeds in the Balearic Islands. It is also an important area for bird migration in periods of rest. However, during the last century, the natural characteristics of this area were modified as a consequence of anthropogenic activities. In fact, the main pressures are: wetland reclamation for infrastructure, wetland drying up, delta regression, dune erosion, field salinisation and abandonment, solid waste disposal, aquifer pollution, port enlargements and reservoir-building causing coastal regression, etc. The Consortium was created in 2006 from the sustainable management, at a regional and local scale, of the coastal, marine and land area in the county of Garraf. Natural areas and the coastal landscape of the Consortium form a true regional Green Belt. 									b) Objectives									The consortium aims to promote the dialogue and the creation of synergies to achieve a sustainable use of the coast. The general political objectives of the Consortium are: (1) ICZM; (2) the completion of the Green Belt district, connecting the coastal areas Colls, Long Beach and the mouth of the Foix, with the natural parks of Garraf and Foix Olèrdola, through a biological network connector associated with roads, streams and green and / or agricultural areas; (3) a territorial analysis, studying the growth pattern, territorial balance, the capacity and sustainability, vulnerability and the protection of the environment and landscape; (4) climate change mitigation and adaptation by  promoting renewable energies, energy conservation, sustainable transport and reducing CO2 emissions; (5) the protection of the marine and coastal zone with emphasis on marine biodiversity, meadows of Posidonia, fishery resources, with the development of the Marine conditioning area of the Garraf coast; (6) the recovery of the historical memory, with the study and conservation of sea-faring traditions, customs, arts and fishing materials and water in general.									6. Implementation of the ICZM Approach (i.e. management, tools, resources)									a) Management									The consortium is currently composed of 3 Regional Government Administrations (the Environment and Housing Department, the Territorial Policy and Public Works Department, and the Agriculture, Food and Rural Action Department of the Catalonia Government) and 5 Local Councils (Vilanova i la Geltrú city council, Sitges city council, Sant Pere de Ribes city council, Cubelles city counvil, Garraf district council)  									b) ICZM tools									The political objectives of the Consortium were developed through a general action plan (adopted in 2007) and biennial action plans to implement it through specific projects.The Consortium Action Plan of Integrated Management consists of 7 strategic lines: (1) Recovery and restoration of natural areas; (2) Improving ecological connectivity between natural systems; (3) Arrangement and regulation of public use. Improving accessibility; (4) Forest fire risk reduction; (5) the protection and improvement of the marine ecosystem of Garraf; (6) Fighting coastal erosion and the effects of climate change; (7) Reducing CO2 emissions.									The biennial Action Plan 2009-2010 includes the implementation of the following areas of work: (1) Avant project of Garraf footpaths; (2) Special protection plan and restoration of Riera de Ribes; (3) Artificial reefs park; (4) Garraf coasts area management plan of the Natura 2000 network; (5) Follow-up and control project of marine flowering plants and Caulerpa racemosa (with SARC, Submon, and DAAAR); (6) OBSEA project (with the group SARTI/UPC); (7) I International Workshop on ICZM; (8) Monitoring plan and environmental information for Colls; (9) Employment surveillance plan, cleaning and maintenance of Colls; (10) Training courses for local technicians (with the Diputació de Barcelona); (11)  Environmental education Project in Aran ship. The timescale for the implementation and goals achievement is associated with each biennial Action Plan. 									7. Cost and resources									The consortium draws on the contributions of its members. The budget is €120,000/year. With the inclusion of remnants of previous budgets and grants obtained in 2009 reaching €281,000. To this amount must be added the contribution of staff from the Municipality of Vilanova valued at €71,500. The sum equals the actual cost of the Consortium for 2009 of € 352,500.The consortium currently has no personnel, and bases its operation with the transfer of staff detailed (from the Vilanova city council) and the involvement of technicians and administrative of other members.									8. Effectiveness (i.e. were the foreseen goals/objectives of the work reached?)									The Consortium has consolidated its presence and organisation, incorporating all municipalities from the Garraf coast and the involvement of the Government of Catalonia. It has also consolidated its proposal in the field of experimentation in ICZM, and the proposal of an integrated management at local level. It has accomplished and executed specific visible projects, such as park reefs, footpaths, the restoration of the Ribes bank, marine area management, etc.									Despite some economic and management difficulties, the objectives are being achieved in the timescale defined.									9. Success and Fail factors									Factors that were helpful in achieving the objectives are: the environmental and landscape values of Garraf coast, its proximity to metropolitan areas, the implication of local coastal management, the coordination with regional institutions and the use of Colls process as a case study on ICZM. As internal negative factors: the complexity of coastal legislation, the dispersion of responsibilities among local, regional, national and European levels, the lack of confidence of the general society in the administration and the lack of resources. Also the growing awareness towards environmental issues and climate change and the involvement of society in general. The main obstacles were the diversity and complexity of legislative powers, the excessive separation between the state and local policies in Europe, and the difficulty in raising awareness of the Consortium.									10. Unforeseen outcomes									The positive impacts of the process lie with the amplification of projects related to the objectives of the consortium driven by others such as UPC OBSEA project, monitoring of Posidonia meadows, with the discovery in Vilanova of the presence of invasive algae Caulerpa racemosa, and the international Consortium after the conclusion of the Ist International Workshop on ICZM that took place in Sitges and Vilanova (1 and 2 October 2009). The growing awareness of the Consortium is also gradually increasing their availability to arrange strategic joint action and act as a real table of consensus and co-ordination. The negative outcomes are related to (1) the complexity of political and administrative difficulties of developing projects and their slowness; and (2) the difficulty of obtaining the necessary resources that increases as projects evolve and grow.									11.

(DE) PILTZ C * THE CYPRUS RESEARCH AND EDUCATIONAL FOUNDATION (CY)  * UNIVERSITAET KASSE FP 7 International COMBINE proposes to improve ESMs by including key physical and biogeochemical processes to model more accurately the forcing mechanisms and the feedbacks determining the magnitude of climate change in the 21st century. For this purpose the project will incorporate carbon and nitrogen cycle, aerosols coupled to cloud microphysics and chemistry, proper stratospheric dynamics and increased resolution, ice sheets and permafrost in current Earth system models. COMBINE also proposes to improve initialization techniques to make the best possible use of observation based analyses of ocean and ice to benefit from the predictability of the climate system in predictions of the climate of the next few decades. Combining more realistic models and skilful initialization is expected to reduce the uncertainty in climate projections.
Resulting effects will be investigated in the physical climate system and in impacts on water availability and agriculture, globally and in 3 regions under the influence of different climate feedback mechanisms. Results from the comprehensive ESMs will be used in an integrated assessment model to test the underlying assumptions in the scenarios, and hence to contribute to improved scenarios. COMBINE will make use of the experimental design and of the scenarios proposed for IPCC AR5. COMBINE will contribute to better assessments of changes in the physical climate system and of their impacts in the societal and economic system. The proposed work will strengthen the scientific base for environmental policies of the EU for the climate negotiations, and will provide input to the IPCC/AR5 process.

It is largely attributable to human activity where greenhouse gases (GHG) are released into the atmosphere. The oceans exert a considerable influence on the atmosphere by absorbing a large fraction of GHGs, but there remain large uncertainties in the budget. This underscores the importance of conducting research concerned with air-sea gas fluxes in order to work toward a reduction in these uncertainties.
The scientific objectives of this proposal are to simultaneously measure the fluxes of climatically relevant compounds in both the coastal and oceanic marine atmospheric boundary layer. The proposed species are carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide, and carbon monoxide. All species will be detected at 1-10 Hz, which will allow for fluxes to be directly determined using the eddy correlation method. This proposed method takes advantage of recently-developed trace gas analyser (TGA) technology. The TGA will be deployed at the Mace Head Research Station where a time series over several years will be acquired. The system will also be deployed periodically on research ships to compare the magnitude of the fluxes in the coastal regions with open ocean data. If funded, this measurement will be one of the first of its kind deployed in the marine atmospheric boundary layer, and will provide an invaluable time series of the fluxes over an extended period. The Returning Research Fellow (RRF) for this proposal has spent the previous 7 years as a fulltime researcher in the field of air--sea exchange in the USA, where he has established a level of excellence in gaining funding and conducting research. Funding from the IRG programme will allow the RRF to establish a research programme in Europe, with the objective of fully integrating into the European Research Area.

Possible impacts will be assessed: a) at a global scale; b) for centres of endemism for vascular plants, birds, mammals, amphibian and reptiles; c) in CI global biodiversity hotspots; and d) for the Global 200 ecoregions. In just the same way that Conservation International recognise biodiversity hotspots, by considering the combined effects of land use change and biodiversity value, an aim of the proposed work is to map regions of climate-induced rapid loss in species richness, which will be described as climatic biodiversity hotspots (ClimBioHotspots).
 Identification of vulnerable to climate change areas, where species extinction for the five taxa and three categories is expected to be highest, requires several steps:
- To collect and harmonise databases (biotic, environmental, land use, human population density, climate scenario)
- To test existing tools and methods, including the species-energy relationship for vascular plants and general dissimilarity models and software, a means of predicting total, endemic and threatened species-richness.
- To develop new concepts and statistical models for estimating dissimilarity in intra-taxa congruence.

This will be achieved by bringing together different scientific disciplines and by enhancing and fostering communication between researchers, policy-makers and practitioners from across Europe.

CapHaz-Net focuses on synthesizing and integrating knowledge and perspectives from five topics: risk perception, social vulnerability, risk communication, risk education, risk governance. These are central for developing social capacities of societies and communities for natural hazards. For each topic, main perspectives, actions and initiatives are identified and assessed that can improve capacity building. The project is structured in three phases: In a first phase key studies and initiatives will be identified and assessed within each of the main topics, achieved through literature review work and thematic meetings.

 The outcome will be a living document representing the state of the art and providing initial suggestions on how to improve society''s capacity building. In the second phase these results will be down-scaled in particular regional contexts and evaluated in respect of local experiences and existing practices and tools, achieved through a series of regional hazard workshops. The network will consider three geographical areas representing different natural hazards types. During these workshops best practices and chances of improved legal tools and strategies but also gaps of knowledge are identified and assessed.

In the final phase, the network will integrate findings and develop recommendations that provide a synthesis concerning specific steps to improve social capacity building of European societies facing natural hazards and give guidance for future research.

Today, some of the most obvious symptoms of changing climate, such as ice shelf melting and ocean temperature rise, are being observed in the Southern Ocean and coastal Antarctica. Leading hypotheses for the cause of the low atmospheric CO2 levels at the last glacial maximum include Southern Ocean processes such as enhanced biological productivity or stronger vertical stratification. Constraining the rates and amplitude of environmental change (on both millennial and decadal timescales) in the Southern Ocean is, therefore an important goal of climate science. This sensitivity of the Southern Ocean to climate perturbation means that the fauna that live there are likely to experience large changes in their environments. 
Carbonate organisms are at risk from ocean acidification, with deep-sea corals being a group that is likely to be particularly vulnerable. However, our understanding of how climate change may affect the distribution and health of cold-water corals is inadequate and improving this understanding is a pressing concern for conservation efforts.  This project seeks to combine existing and novel geochemical approaches to optimize the use of deep-sea coral skeletons as archives of past Southern Ocean climate. The records produced during the reintegration period will provide data suited to testing hypotheses linking Southern Ocean circulation to global climate on timescales from decades to millennia and will provide unique insights into the history of deep-sea coral population dynamics.

Overview of the case									The Romanian Black Sea coast is facing long term shoreline erosion problems. Since the 1980s, the southern part of the Romanian coast, where the most economic and social activities are located, is threatened by a steady increase of erosion phenomena which has caused severe damage in terms of beach losses, tourism and recreation facilities and public safety. Since 2005, coastal protection became a priority for the Romanian government. Taking into account the serious threat of coastal erosion, the government requested support from the Japanese Government. Through its Agency JICA (Japan International Cooperation Agency), Romania received international technical assistance and financial support to develop a comprehensive study for coastal protection and rehabilitation of the southern part of the Romanian Black Sea coastal area. The main outcome of the study was the Master Plan for coastal protection delivered at the end of 2007. 									5. Context and Objectives									a) Context									The total length of the Romanian coastline is about 244 km. The Black Sea coast has distinct geographical features divided into two management areas. The northern area of the Romanian coast is a deltaic coast of the Danube; part of the Danube Delta Biosphere Reserve, a World Heritage Site, with a particular management regime. The southern area with a length of about 70 km consists of cliffs interrupted by small beaches with sand dunes backed by lakes which formed, in the past, coastal lagoons. The latter area is more socio-economically developed (e.g. harbours , tourism, coastal cities) and more densely populated than the northern area. Since the 1970’s, the southern coastal area has been significantly damaged by erosion produced by natural and human-induced causes (climate change and sea level rise, dramatic changes of sediment loads from the Danube, alteration of the longshore drift supplying the beaches, intensity of storm and wave attack, jetty construction, sand extraction, etc). To prevent and stop the erosion in the southern part of the Romanian coast, coastal protection measures were carried out between 1970 - 80 by the government consisting of a combination of hard and soft coastal protection measures (groynes, breakwaters and artificial beach nourishment). During the last two decades, the existing monitoring programme for coastal erosion has revealed that the coastal erosion processes have increased again and provided evidence that the protection measures of coastal erosion mitigation have had only positive effects for a short time and space perspective. Furthermore, the coastal protection measures implemented in the southern area, vulnerable to erosion, were also generating other environmental problems along the Romanian Black Sea Coast. As a consequence, Romania has started to make considerable efforts to protect the coastal zones particularly the southern part of the coast.									b) Objectives									The study undertook by JICA on the rehabilitation and protection of the southern part of the Romanian coast had the objective to formulate a coastal protection Master Plan for the southern coastal area and to propose priority projects to stop and prevent the coastal erosion process along the Romanian Black sea Coast. 									6. Implementation of the ICZM Approach (i.e. management, tools, resources)									a) Project Management									In Romania, according to the ICZM law put in place in 2003, beaches and coastal cliffs are acknowledged as a public domain for which the Ministry of Environment is the responsible government authority as well as for coastal protection. At the local level, the management for beaches and cliffs are not carried out by the coastal municipalities but by the Environmental ministry’s executive agency the National Administration of Romanian Waters (NARW), Coastal Water Directorate named Water Directorate Dobrogea Litoral. This is responsible for implementing the water strategy and policy, quantitative and qualitative water management as well as for the operation of water infrastructure. Consequently, the Ministry of Environment has been playing an important role as a beneficiary of the coastal studies and together with the local authority responsible for beach management arrangements for developing the legal framework.  									b) ICZM tools									In 2005, a baseline survey study for coastal protection in the southern part of the Romanian coast against erosion was initially developed by the JICA. The study comprised socio-, economic- and environmental aspects. Later on, in the second phase, it was focused on the assessment of the Mamaia and Eforie barrier beaches and the pocket beaches, southward, identification of the main causes of beach erosion, division of the coastal areas into vulnerable sub-areas, shoreline changes under the local hydrological conditions (waves, sea level, currents) as well as short and long term shoreline predictions. The main study aim was to develop a Master Plan for coastal protection of the southern part of the Romanian coast which a preliminary design of the coastal protection measures necessary to be implemented within the time scale of 2015. By the end of 2007, the Master plan and feasibility studies for two priority areas (Mamaia Beach and Eforie Nord) were developed by JICA using their own funds. For the other priority projects identified in the Master Plan, the funds will be allocated by the Romanian government although the technical assistance may still be provided by JICA. The protection coastal measures identified in the Master Plan for the two priority areas were mainly directed towards hard protection such as breakwaters and groynes and to a lesser degree by  soft protection such as artificial reefs and artificial sand nourishments. In addition, maintenance of the existing hard structure or removal of the inadequate and non-effective old structures were also considered as necessary coastal works. 									An assessment of the coastal protection measures in terms of estimated costs for operation, maintenance and a management plan, legal and institutional framework, was carried out by the Romanian institutions. A Strategic Environmental Assessmenthas been applied for the Master Plan and its outcomes paving the way for a Strategic Plan for coastal protection. Also an EIA and public debate of the two priority projects were conducted. 									7. Cost and resources									For 2007-2010, the estimation of the total costs was about €44 million for the implementation of the protection coastal works for the two priority projects. Over the period 1998-2015, the estimated total cost for the implementation of the Master Plan for coastal protection was €316 million. 									8. Effectiveness (i.e. were the foreseen goals/objectives of the work reached?)									The costs of the coastal measures estimated by the Japanese study and to be paid by the Romanian government have to be weighed against the socio-economic damages incurred in the event that no protection measures will be executed. The main causes of erosion along the Romanian shores are identified as: sediment withdrawal up stream of the Danube river, on-going global sea level rise (since mid 19th Cent: 15 cm/century), and locally by protruding constructions like harbour jetties. Coastal erosion caused by deficiency of sediment supply to the coast is most effectively combated not so much by hard but by soft coastal measures such as large scale sand nourishment filling up the sand budget deficit along the coast. Modelling three dimensional sand movements along the Romanian coast is a preliminary way to estimate the duration that nourished sand will stay in its sediment circulation cell. As a result, the 2007 – 2010 plans have not been executed and are still pending to be put into practice .									9. Success and Fail factors									The success of combating coastal erosion depends very much on the type of measures which will be chosen and the way they will be prepared, executed, monitored and evaluated. Starting with well prepared, executed and monitored sand nourishment pilots along the Romanian coast will provide a growing knowledge on how beneficial this way of combating coastal erosion will be both economically and ecologically. These anticipated pilots accompanied by frequent and detailed monitoring will provide more knowledge on how long the nourished sand will be acting as sand buffer. This will increase the confidence in the cost and benefit analyses. 									10. Unforeseen outcomes									None.									11. Prepared by									Drd.

The specific project objectives can be outlined as follows:
- to prevent and mitigate the damages derived by highly critical hydro-geological events through the adoption of non-structural interventions
- to secure economic and social cohesion in what are considered marginal regions (a condition common to many areas located in sub-regional river catchments)
- to achieve co-ordinated water emergency management by using the resources actually available on the territory
- to minimize flood risks threatening the population in areas of high hydro-geological vulnerability at both economic and social level. 
- to compare the specific procedures adopted by local authorities and governments in order to find solutions for efficiency enhancement
- to define new standards for intervention 
- to build up local and transnational networks for flash flood risk management
- to perform pilot actions (flash flood simulation)

For example, responses to the melting of ice in the Arctic and in other  glacier areas, the rising of seas that flood islands and coastal communities, and the drying of lands accelerating desertification in large parts of Africa and elsewhere. The proposed research is groundbreaking empirically as well as theoretically. Empirically it contributes a substantial ethnographic supplement to the sweeping diagnoses of the global malaises captured in notions like global warming .
Theoretically, the project allows for a new, general understanding of the effects of environmental disaster on social life, and of the responsibility that people take locally to ensure the survival of their community. The project rethinks the human implications of global climate change by way of an explication of what is and what can be done on the ground. The perspective is predominantly anthropological with a component of human geography as well as eskimology. The focus on water-related environmental risks as experienced in different regions of the world allows for a comparative perspective yielding general theoretical innovation. The knowledge thus gained may contribute to new policies of redress that the global diagnoses cannot by themselves bring about. What is more, it may open up for new interdisciplinary cooperation, by contributing to an explication of the complexities of scale inherent in different conceptual worlds and by suggesting new and more integrative forms of knowledge.

The principle outcome was increased public awareness and knowledge about the risk of flooding, and greater understanding of the actions that need to be taken by the general public, scientists, and politicians during a flood event. This was achieved through the establishment of a transnational disaster management strategy for flooding situations in one or more of the coastal areas of the North Sea region. The strategy included integrated national, regional or local contingency plans intended to reduce the effects of flooding disasters and will link the HIS (High Water Information System) and an evacuation model which provided a new and innovative approach to contingency plans and planning.
The videos/DVD’s, the ‘Watersnoodkrant’ (Flooding Newspaper), and the conferences increased the awareness for the effects and consequences of flooding and provided answers to the people and professionals on how to act and react in case of flooding. Both the HIS-model (High Water Information System), as well as the DSS-model proved to be highly innovative models that did prove their added value in the pilots performed as part of the project.

Risk information embedded in instruments of spatial planning will serve as basis for sustainable development in the Elbe river basin. Here protection from floods plays a decisive role. Besides the new risk-preventive requirements for spatial planning, the current land-use planning must be adapted to the flood risk. With the provision of risk information and its implementation into the relevant planning the attractive and sustainable development of the economically important Elbe region will be assured. Among others the challenges of climate change and new strategies for adaptation provide opportunities for the development of the regions.

The final aim is to raise social awareness on the protection and conservation of the coastal area.  									4. Overview of the case									This ICZM initiative is based on the information, education and awareness of the society concerning the coastal zone and its management with the aim of promoting its conservation. It planned to inform the coastal populations about the coastal system, its current state, the threats affecting it, the coastal legislation, the Maritime-Terrestrial Public Domain and Integrated Coastal Zone Management.									5. Context and Objectives									a) Context									The Spanish coast has important cultural, ecological and landscape values. Nowadays, 32% of the total population is living in coastal areas which are subject to an enormous pressure due to urban expansion and the different socio-economic activities. Besides that, competences on the coastal zone are shared between different sectoral administrations at the national, regional and local level. The competence on coastal management is held by the Directorate General for the Coast (DGC). The problems and issues for which this initiative has been developed are related to massive, unplanned and unsustainable occupation of the coastal zone, deterioration of coastal ecosystems, coastal erosion, climate change effects, lack of knowledge on the coastal zones, unco-ordinated decision-making, and insufficient public participation in the decision-making process. This initiative has been promoted by the national level and implemented at the local level.									b) Objectives									The specific objectives to achieve were the following:																																Inform and educate the society on the importance of the coastal system, its functioning, its state and the threats affecting it.													Inform and educate the society on the current coastal legislation and regulations at the European and national level, ICZM and the importance of the Maritime-Terrestrial Public Domain (MTPD).													Alert the society of the coastal protection and conservation, in particular the MTPD, and the need to progressively recover the coasts’ natural attributes and functionality.																															The timescale associated with implementation and goal achievement was 2 years.									6. Implementation of the ICZM Approach (i.e. management, tools, resources)									a) Project Management									The Directorate General for the Coast – Ministry of Environment, Rural and Marine Affairs- promoted this initiative to explain to the citizens the current coastal management in Spain. The project was designed and promoted at the national level but implemented through the travelling exhibition at the local level. All coastal residents were invited to attend the exhibition.  									b) ICZM tools									The initiative is an information, education and social awareness tool.									The exhibition includes 5 classrooms in which several issues are dealt with in an easy, accessible and attractive way. Appealing and modern formats are used in order to capture the visitor’s interest, such as scale models, plasma screens, glass floors with scale models underneath, collages Plexiglas and aluminium scale models, water screens, virtual people, etc.. Finally, a final summary on the current situation of the Spanish coast is presented by two Experts, one from the Spanish Sustainability Observatory and the other a Full Professor on Environmental Sciences and an IPCC collaborator.  																																Room 1: the Heart of the Coast. The main topic is the MTPD, free shoreline access, the importance of its conservation and the DGC mechanisms for it, such as the “Demarcations Plan” and the “Lands acquisition Plan”.													Room 2: ICZM. The definition of ICZM is explained, giving its origins and justification, its objectives, procedures and mechanisms, and the European legal context. The main message in this room is the need to recover the coast to its natural state and functionality.													Room 3: Coastal ecosystems. The coastal ecosystem formation, operation and location is explained in this room.													Room 4: marine ecosystems. The same information as the previous room is offered, applied to the marine ecosystems.													Room 5: Threats to the Spanish coast. All the current threats affecting the Spanish coast (climate change, massive coastal occupation, high urban planning pressure, pollution, etc.) are presented.																															7. Cost and resources									The budget for this initiative was €4.219.774. The manpower used for the exhibition design includes designers, draftsmen, computing experts, etc. The manpower used for the implementation of the travelling exhibition includes carpenters, electricians, sound and image technicians, hostesses, monitors, Maintenance technician, security staff, cleaners, etc. 									8. Effectiveness (i.e. were the foreseen goals/objectives of the work reached?)									The foreseen objectives have been achieved as the exhibition has covered the whole Spanish territory and a large number of its residents have been informed and educated in the fundamental concepts of the coastal zone and its management to increase social awareness on its protection. The exhibition took place in 7 municipalities: the Spanish capital (Madrid), 3 north Atlantic coastal areas (La Coruña, Vigo and Santander), 1 south Atlantic coastal municipality (Huelva) and 2 Mediterranean coastal areas (Almeria and Malaga). Neighbouring coastal municipalities were also invited to attend. An average of 600-700 visitors per day visited the exhibition during the 11 days it remained in each city, reaching a final average of 6.600-7.700 visitors per city.									The objectives were achieved within the designated schedule.									9. Success and Fail factors									Factors that were helpful in achieving the objective were:																																The inauguration carried out by the Minister of Environment, General Secretariat or Director General, depending on the case.													Sending out invitations in advance to all the schools in the city, to encourage them to make a reservation for a guided visit.

Climate change issues are clearly a growing concern for the public today.
In recent years, people have received a great deal of information from media on the causes and consequences of climate changes, but depending on countries and regions the understanding of citizens and their engagement in these topics is still varied. ACCENT proposes to contribute to a global effort to move the campaign on climate change from informative to the active phase, through the exchange and dissemination of practices, with specific actions that encourage the involvement of citizens in actions and dialogue. The rising demand for public participation is evident when addressing global challenges; in this sense, involvement of the public would be central to the ACCENT strategy to improve the capacity of European democracies to represent and include citizens'' perspectives. Through ACCENT, the science centre community is committing itself to strengthening the efforts its institutions made at the local level in a one year European Communication Action on Climate change issues for the dissemination of European research results, and to establishing the dialogue among scientists, stakeholders and the public through participative practices. They will capitalize on their competences in a European sustainable Web platform that will act as collector as well as disseminator for any organizations dealing with public engagement in science. ACCENT will assess the outcomes from the engagement and participation of the public in order to deliver reliable data on the opinion and perception of European citizens about climate change issues.

Impacts on the disturbance regime are particularly relevant in this regard. In a sound science-based sustainable forest management/ ecosystem management approach (SFEM) potential changes in climate and disturbance regimes need to be considered explicitly. Disturbance dynamics, however, are still poorly understood especially in ecosystems with interacting, climate-sensitive disturbance agents. Currently, most available model approaches suffer either from a limited spatial extent to address large scale interacting disturbance regimes (i.e. stand models) or a coarse structural resolution with regard to the information needs in resource management (i.e. landscape models).
The objective of the proposed research is to bridge this gap in
(i) developing an individual-based landscape modeling framework;
(ii) adopting process-oriented disturbance modules and utilizing existing ecological understanding to model disturbance interactions, and
(iii) testing the model framework in two case studies in the temperate forest biome.
 To successfully address (interactions between) disturbances as emerging property of the modeled system as well as to provide relevant levels of information in the context of SFEM an individual-based, process-oriented landscape modeling approach is proposed. The development will bring together recent advances in forest landscape modeling with efficient algorithms of modeling individual-based tree competition and process-based production. Existing disturbance models for selected agents will be adopted focusing on interactions and climate sensitivity. The framework will be parameterized and evaluated in two cases studies in the Eastern Alps (Austria) and the Pacific Northwest (USA). Overall, the modeling framework aims at contributing to questions of SFEM under changing climate and disturbance regimes and facilitating a landscape perspective in forest resource management.

* identify and quantify globally the mechanisms underlying the transformation of biogenic particles to dissolved substances within the ocean water column in order to predict correctly surface ocean carbon dioxide sources and sinks; 
* develop a refined particle flux model for operational use in ocean general circulation models which realistically describes particle dynamics in the water column, deposition of material to the sediment, and the interaction with the carbon dioxide partial pressure pCO2; 
* provide a global closed carbon and nutrient budget for modern (preindustrial) conditions including the water column sediment interaction; 
* estimate the changes in CO2 sea surface source sink patterns and vertical redistributions of carbon as well as nutrients for future global change, climate change as well as carbon sequestration scenarios including the associated potential economic impacts. 
 The project will result in best estimates of sea surface CO2 source sink patterns. Comprehensive observational data bases on surface ocean pCO2 and marine carbon cycle data will be collated and made publically available through web access.

Overview of the case									The cross-border Finnish-Russian initiative ‘People, Nature and Harbours’ concerned solving environmental problems, exchange of information and methodologies of nature conservation and protected area management, pilot projects and study tours. The Finnish aspect consisted of three parts which were 1) planning the management of  Natura 2000 area in Lake Pihlajavesi; 2) stocktaking of underwater nature in eastern Gulf of Finland; and 3) the seals in the Gulf of Finland. The Russian aspect consisted of six parts, several pilots,  underwater inventories of marine habitats and species and the seals in the Gulf of Finland and in Lake Ladoga. 									5. Context and Objectives									a) Context									The main target of the Finnish work was to further develop a participatory approach towards joint management of the multiple use of protected areas with unique, vulnerable and especially valuable species using Lake Pihlajavesi and the endemic Saimaa seal as a pilot area. It worked for enhancing the local understanding and acceptance of nature protection, and developing a joint management system for the area. Land use and management planning processes for mosaic-like areas with several land-owners and land-use purposes require applying the ecosystem approach in the planning. It is essential, therefore, to pay attention to the social dimension of planning, in addition to the ecological and social dimensions  In the Russian part of the work, approaches for public participation and stakeholder involvement into joint management, conservation and sustainable use of natural sites were tested. Methods of joint monitoring systems of the eastern Gulf of Finland were developed for the seal populations’ monitoring and for marine habitats and species.									b) Objectives									The principal objectives of the project were to protect and monitor internationally and regionally important nature areas situated on the river basin of the eastern Gulf of Finland, and to develop, in co-operation with local stakeholders, sustainable protection and use of nature areas as part of social and economic development. Specific objectives were developing protection and monitoring marine ecosystems in the Eastern Gulf of Finland; and researching the impacts of climate change on underwater nature and state of seal populations. The objectives of the Russian part of the project were, to test the approaches for public participation and stakeholder involvement into joint management, conservation and sustainable use of natural sites; and to complement the establishment of a harmonised monitoring of the eastern Gulf of Finland catchment. 									6. Implementation of the ICZM Approach (i.e. management, tools, resources)									a) Management									The Ministry of the Environment in Finland and Metsähallitus were responsible for the Finnish part of the project. Metsähallitus was responsible for the implementation of the project. National authorities involved were the South Karelian Association and South-East Regional Environmental Centre. Also environmental administration, the Game and Fishery Research Institute and Sea Research Institute and municipalities co-operated intensively with each other. Specific work was done by working groups. In the Russian part of the project, Metsähallitus had the role of an overall lead partner with the Saint Petersburg Naturalist Society (SPNS)  taking the role of the responsible partner for the general co-ordination and implementation. 									b) ICZM  tools									One of the ICZM tools in the Finnish part has been developing and utilising a multi-purpose planning for Natura 2000 areas with ecosystem services included in the planning procedure taking recreational values and tourism into account.  Stakeholder participation and specific co-operative working methods have been utilised. Methodological development of inventories concerning e.g Saimaa Ringed Seals; marine environment; alien species etc. are important tools for planning and decision-making. In the Russian part, digital maps of land use of pilot areas have been created and materials for management plans of the four pilot sites have been prepared by the project experts..									7. Cost and resources									The objectives of the project were realized and intended results reached. However, meeting the objectives of the cross-border co-operation between south-east Finland – Russia proved to be somewhat difficult. Due to the separate supervision and management of the financing instruments, the result was actually implementation of two separate endeavours with equal names and with similar contents in the neighbouring countries. In the Finnish part; the aim of the Pihlajavesi master plan was to contribute to the development and use of participatory planning and decision making methods and increasing efficiency of the plan. Essential was to reach stakeholders in close connection with the Pihlajavesi area. In spite of seal protection, the growth of the seal stock has stopped in recent years.  Indicator-based monitoring of climate change and other human activities in the Gulf of Finland is of great importance; methodology of marine inventories was further developed and data on marine habitats and species was collected. In the Russian part; the work was carried out according to the action plan approved. However, the constant re-organisations of the Environmental administration of the Leningrad Region has somewhat hindered effective management of regional protected areas and caused also problems in implementation.									8. Effectiveness (i.e. were the foreseen goals/objectives of the work reached?)									The costs of the Finnish part were €300,000 in total and the costs of the Russian part were €250,000.									9. Success and Fail factors									In Finland: The objectives were largely met. Participative planning, intensive co-operation between stakeholders and commonly agreed  objectives increase the safety and living conditions of Saimaa ringed seals. Engagement of local people to seal protection is of great importance. New and sensitive indicators found in water inventories (Monoporeia affinis; Saduria entomon) improve the possibilities to monitor impacts of climate change on sea water. In Russia: Preparation of materials and development of methodologies for the management of the pilot sites contributed to the conservation of biodiversity in the vicinity of Saint Petersburg. However, further management responsibilities of these facilities are unclear. The main problem was the continuous re-organisation of nature conservation bodies in the government of the Leningrad Region. Another fail factor was the weak co-operation with the harbours of Primorsk and Ust-Luga. As two of the largest harbours of the Gulf of Finland having huge environmental impacts to the ecosystem of the Gulf and its catchment area the harbours were originally a target. Co-operation was planned to reduce the environmental effects of them, but unfortunately almost no response was received from the harbour authorities. 									10. Unforeseen outcomes									None in the Finnish part but in the Russian part, a nature trail supposed to be constructed would have required an EIA; no such assessment could be done and so it could not be constructed. Also there are unclear responsibilities of further management of recreational equipment which has led to the exclusion of constructing recreational infrastructure in the River Svir Delta pilot site. 									11.

Overview of the case									Different thematic groups have been working together for 18 months to define an experimental programme of actions. Three themes have been determined which represent the main issues of the Côte d''Opale: coastal erosion, marine pollution, and coastal land ownership. 									5. Context and Objectives									a) Context									The representatives of the Côte d''Opale, a coastal border area in the north of France participated in the ICZM demonstration programme (1996-99). In this Region, an inter-institutional partnership between State, region and territory has been established for a number of years. It is recognised as having some weaknesses e.g. it is mainly sector-based; there is a lack of co-ordination and difficult involvement of the various local levels; and there is a rapid turnover of the persons who are involved in the steps weakens the long-term partnership process. However, for many years now, this territory has been aware of the issues needed for sustainable development and has reached near-consensus about the future evolution of the area. Many tools of management are available: a management plan, a coastal monitoring body, and protection of wide coastal areas.									b) Objectives									The objectives concern several levels in relationship to the variously involved partners. They concern more particularly the following themes:																																a better consideration being given to marine and coastal issues by the regional authorities;													finalisation of an efficient programme of actions following several year-long studies which could find their place in the negotiation of the future CPER (“Contrat de Plan Etat-Région”) which specifies the financing by both parties;													developing a knowledge tool (atlas), co-constructed and interactive, assessing the impact of human actions on the sea-land interface;													strengthening and evolution of the relationship between financing managers (especially the Regional Council) and scientists.																															6. Implementation of the ICZM Approach (i.e. management, tools, resources)									a) Management									The project was driven by the « Syndicat Mixte de la Côte d’Opale” (SMCO), which is recognised as a discussion and co-ordination structure. It brings together coastal towns and district communities, Chambers of Commerce and Industry, Chambers of Agriculture, county councils of the North and Pas-de-Calais. The Regional Council and university of “Littoral - Côte d’Opale” (ULCO) were also partners. The management was carried out by a running committee bringing together all the representatives of the local and State administrative services, as well as the technical and scientific institutions of the territory concerned.									b) ICZM tools									The approach was based exclusively on thematic working groups. These groups were actually informal and brought together the traditional stakeholders: local government and services, as well as some representatives of scientific circles.									As regards to the theme erosion, a special organisation was chosen as the group was divided into two, on one side technicians of local and national authorities and on the other scientists from ULCO university (GEODAL laboratory). The team that had to run and deal with the initiative (one representative of SMCO + several “marine environment” representatives of the Regional Council) acted as a link and “translator” between both groups. The various groups have produced more or less successfully action-forms, concerning in particular, the gap in knowledge.									7. Cost and resources									SMCO allocated specific means to run the project by recruiting a special representative. A sum of €60,000  from the DIACT programme was also granted.									8. Effectiveness (i.e. were the foreseen goals/objectives of the work reached?)									Apart from the erosion  group which was able to structure different action-forms, the other thematic groups could not reach their proposed objectives within the 18 months limit. Moreover the project Sea/Land atlas, which intended to structure the whole approach, was not supported by the requested partners in the suggested shape. It had to be re-oriented and failed to help the other groups as it was planned. At the same time, the structural evolution inside the Regional Council and orientation of the negotiation about the CPER failed to reach the objective to give a better place to coastal and marine management in current programmes. 									9. Success and Fail factors									The success of the erosion group can be explained in several ways but two reasons seem fundamental:																																the different partners recognised that SMCO was the correct body to examine this question, contrary to the other themes (especially the marine themes).													the choice to divide the working group in two (scientists / technicians) avoided misunderstanding which was encountered by the other groups.																															The problems to get funds especially for some flagship actions (within the scope of the previous CPER or during the negotiated new one) had a negative effect. Finally because the project was carried out at the regional level it was not possible to associate the civil population to the process or to find bodies able to be in charge of the proposed actions at the interface sea / land.									10. Unforeseen outcomes									Although all the proposed objectives could not be reached within the allotted time, the project has allowed the institutional stakeholders and managers to better know one other, especially those from local authorities and the marine world. Through a common approach to various issues, the meetings have contributed to set up the creation of the future “three estuaries marine park”.   									11.

As areas become stressed due to water exploitation or environmental pressures, the amount of water resources available for use have been decreasing (World Meteorological Organisation, 1999) and Europe has not been able to avoid these pressures. It is crucial to protect and improve water consumption to provide a sustainable practice for economic development and to maintain human settlements. 
LOWTEV will bring considerable water savings to the food industry which is comprised of over 230,000 SME organisations. With an excellent consortium with experts in the fields of food science and sanitisation we will develop a low water pressure ultrasound device integrated with an automated rapid hygiene monitoring system. By providing an alternative system for cleaning in place technology on bulk handling equipment for food processors, a factory site would benefit from at least a 10% savings in overall water use. This equates to an estimated 30,000 worth of savings on water and energy bills per factory, providing a return on investment in under 1 year of installation. The food industry sector within Europe lag behind in terms of innovation and R &D investment; this project will address the environmental issues to improve water resources and will also improve the competitiveness of the SME food processing and bulk handling communities. 
 Through reducing the clean cycle times on conveyor equipment, this will realise more productivity within the food processing cycle by reducing the labour costs and times for cleaning.

In the field of Public Transport (WP2), customer needs shall be better understood. New service structures will be developed and implemented, e.g. regional transport integration with seamless electronic ticketing, improved information and image orientated awareness raising.
Soft modes are in the focus of WP3 - image campaigns (e.g. bike-festival) and joint actions (e.g. cycle-to-work with health insurance and employers), new services (e.g. bike-stations) will be integrated with measures of bike-planning and ''cycle safely''. Information for cyclists will become part of intermodal (PT) journey planners.

Three representative CEE Countries are studied in detail: Hungary, Romania, and Bulgaria.

In the framework of CLAVIER, ongoing and future climate changes are analysed based existing data and on climate projections with very high detail to fulfill the need of local and regional impact assessment. Researchers from 6 countries and different disciplines investigate linkages between climate change and its impact on weather patterns, air pollution, extreme events, and on water resources. Furthermore, an evaluation of the economic impact on agriculture, tourism, energy supply and the public sector is conducted.

The acquired experience is offered to the scientific community and other interested groups at the national, regional and local levels, and is shown in seminars and scientific publications.									4. Overview of the case									The Coastal Observatory is a research group of the Marine Studies Institute at the University of A Coruña, which since 2005 studies and researches on coastal policy and law related issues. It organizes National and International Seminars about different coastal-related issues (Maritime Security, Coastal Planning, etc.) and edits several scientific works on the results obtained from the projects carried out by the coastal Observatory members and their associated researchers.									5. Context and Objectives									a) Context									The Coastal Observatory is located in a highly important maritime traffic area (which has suffered several catastrophes - the Mar Egeo and the Prestige ships), has a population which is highly dependant on the fisheries economy and an important natural heritage in the Natura 2000 Network. The Coastal Observatory was created to study the planning, zoning and management processes in the coastal zone due to the problems caused by the complexity of the Spanish legal-constitutional structure which gives the coastal competences to both the national, regional and local governments. The geographical scale for ICZM project implementation is regional and local, although it also considers international experiences. Before the constitution of the Coastal Observatory the members of the research group were already working in different coastal and marine law-fields (coastal zone protection, zoning, marine environment, fisheries and aquaculture legal regulations, etc.)									b) Objectives									The specific objectives to be achieved through the Coastal Observatory in terms of coastal planning are: (1) the promotion of implementation guides, (2) the design of recommendations, (3) the publishing of research studies, and (4) organization expert meetings. Although the group began analysing coastal management issues from a legal point of view, the last publications have increased their multidisciplinary perspective.									The timescale associated with implementation and goals achievement is not defined, but it has been working since 2000.									6. Implementation of the ICZM Approach (i.e. management, tools, resources)									a) Project Management									The implementation of the ICZM studies has involved the authorities and the social groups related to coastal planning and management. The project is mainly oriented to the regionally and locally responsible authorities. The Coastal Observatory does not have responsibility for  coastal planning and management processes. It has participated in several scientific events offering its results and the scientific collaboration to the involved Public Administrations and institutions.									b) ICZM tools									The category of the Coastal Observatory is policy and legislative analysis tool.The specific tools applied are:  coastal planning implementation guides, recommendations, research studies, and expert meetings.A special emphasis should be put on the “Guide to Implementing a Management System for ICZM”, which is to be printed by the Spanish publisher Netbiblo and aims to implement standardised management systems, such as the ISO quality systems. It allows every region, coastal stretch or coastal specific area, to implement the same management rules, facilitating and promoting synergies and making the coastal zones and marine areas more dynamic.The current research project, funded by Xunta de Galicia, is entitled “Legal basis for the planning and zoning of the Galician coastal zone”, for the period 2007-2010.									7. Cost and resources									The funding for the projects comes from research projects at the European, national and regional levels, secured by the Research Group. Concerning the human resources, besides the research group members, the Coastal Observatory relies on the expertise of 50 researchers from Universities and Spanish and International organisms.									8. Effectiveness (i.e. were the foreseen goals/objectives of the work reached?)									The Coastal Observatory, by means of its publications, organization of international seminars, participation in scientific events and experts’ networks has become a reference institution in the field of socio-economic related coastal planning issues. 2 international seminars on ICZM have been organized and several research works have been published up to now. These objectives have been achieved in the timescale defined by each developed project.									9. Success and Fail factors									A factor that was helpful in achieving the objective was the research history of the Coastal Observatory members in the different topics. Another was social interest and awareness –both in Galicia and Spain - of the problems that need an adequate organisational response,  for example, in the fields of maritime security, coastal planning, zoning and management, coastal and marine public policies design, etc.									A factor that hindered the achievement of the goals was the initial difficulty to carry out co-ordinated work and a common language from the multidisciplinary perspective. 									10. Unforeseen outcomes									No unforeseen outcomes have been identified.									11.

Recent studies have detected a response of the boundary between subalpine forests and alpine zones (i.e. the treeline) to climate change, but there is an ongoing controversy about whether or not and how treelines may advance or retreat under current climate trends. This question is however of great interest for the biodiversity of alpine ecotones, and changes in the treeline would have important implications for the global carbon cycle. Thus, there is a need to understand the mechanisms shaping treelines and how different factors operate on them both at local and landscape scales.
 This project is designed to disentangle treeline dynamics, i.e. its spatiotemporal variation and long-term responses to climatic forcing and biological interactions using advanced modeling techniques and an extensive dataset of individual tree age, growth, position, size and recruitment in Pinus uncinata at the Pyrenean range. Spatially-explicit, individual-based models will be employed to simulate treeline spatiotemporal dynamics including both abiotic (temperature and precipitation, especially snow) and biotic factors (e.g. seed viability and dispersal, tree growth), as well as potential synergisms.

The project has acted as a source of inspiration for landowners and managers and helps them to identify not only the means but also the aims for a modernised and multifunctional forest and landscape management. The joint, but different, experiences from the North Sea Region has made it possible to create a digital spatial program that can predict how sensible the forest is for certain wind loads in the whole North Sea Region. This is one of the most interesting products of the project since it is directly accessible on the web. It is a user friendly program that is also of direct value for the end-user (landowner, manager).
The project tested two programmes WINDA and ForestGALE to see how well they could predict areas sensitive to storm and after these two tests, 70-90% of test stands could properly predicted. With information on their own forest and landscape they can now create their own storm risk analysis of their forest and see if there are areas with higher risk.
The Toolbox consists out of different parts.
    * How to keep my trees standing: the results are presented here and will provide information and support when planning your forest.
    * Storms and forestry: information about the occurrence of storms.

More specifically, the following questions will be addressed: 
(1) under which conditions will distribution ranges move, and at what speed? 
(2) will populations at the low-latitude edge of the distribution survive, adapt or go extinct? 
This will be done through the combined use of two existing approaches: theoretical and process-based modelling. Theoretical approaches taking into account genetic and environmental variability, migration, gene flow and adaptation have been developed to predict the width of a species'' range, but they remain hard to parameterize for use in the real world. Process-based models rely on biological observations, and can be used to predict species'' ranges under given environmental conditions; however, they do not yet take evolution into account. 
 TRECC will (1) develop a spatially explicit theoretical model of species'' range evolution, including the effects of drift (stochasticity due to finite populations); (2) calibrate this model using existing data, and the fitness values predicted by the process-based model, on well-studied tree species in a first instance, and modify the process-based model so that it can take into account individual variability and trait evolution, for further use with other species.

This objective will be achieved by integrating three major types of recent and new solid scientific carbon cycle data, from:
- soil process studies,
- a network of established ecosystem manipulation experiments, and
- long-term observations spanning several times-scales (e.g. eddy covariance data, tree rings and growth, crop yields, long-term remote sensing data on soil moisture and vegetation activity and soil carbon inventories).
 The improved models will simulate terrestrial processes relevant to carbon balance and soil erosion at pan- European scale using regionalized climate scenarios with explicit inclusion of extreme climatic events. Since we are using several climate scenarios and an ensemble of models we will be able to characterize the uncertainties in prediction coming from models and climate scenarios. We will interpret the empirical evidence from the observational work and the model simulations in a framework of vulnerability assessment and disseminate and discuss results with stakeholders at EU level.

Vulnerability is a function of exposure to climate change, sensitivity to its effects and adaptive capacity for coping with the effects. These elements are being examined in the project, with indicators being developed in collaboration with regional stakeholders for future periods out to 2050. The indicators will then be combined in various ways to describe vulnerability. Indices of vunerability will be computed at municipality scale and mapped across the Nordic region.

 The primary outcome of this work is an interactive tool for assisting stakeholder groups to design more in depth assessments of local and regional vulnerability. While the mapping of biophysical and social indicators at a sub-national scale across three countries presents methodological challenges, it also reveals focal points (i.e. regions, sectors or communities) that may have difficulties in meeting the challenge of climate change through high exposure, enhanced sensitivity,
limited adaptive capacity, or a combination thereof. Once identified, these focal points can then be analyzed in bottom-up processes to assess the need
for policy interventions to enhance adaptive capacity and to examine the possible barriers in implementing such measures.

Since climate models forecast the largest warming trends on Earth occurring in the Eurasian Arctic, there is urgent need to increase the understanding of its terrestrial carbon release and potential for large-scale climate effects thereon. An ambitious and advanced project is proposed to assess the export and biogeochemical fate (i.e. burial and/or degradation) of large-scale releases of terrestrial organic carbon (TOC) to the Eurasian Artic shelf (EAS) and to evaluate the effect of recent climate warming on TOC remobilization and degradation.
To fulfill this aim, I propose a comprehensive analytical program, including molecular characterization of recalcitrant forms organic matter and compound-specific radiocarbon analysis (CSRA) of terrestrial lipid biomarkers, to a strategic sample set from the most vulnerable Eurasian Artic regions. The poorly studied EAS is the world´s largest continental shelf system, receiving large influxes of fire-derived and soil-released OC.  Advanced CSRA and relative distributions analysis of a broad suite of lipid terrestrial biomarkers, would afford much improved understanding of TOC processing on the EAS, whereas similar analyses in dated sediment cores, correlated with climate indices (e.g. Arctic Oscillation), would reveal effects of recent climate change on the large-scale C cycle. Further, export of Siberian fire-derived black carbon (BC) would be assessed by a combination of chemothermal oxidation and benzenepolycarboxylic acids methods. Burial of recalcitrant BC in shelf sediments is an important but poorly constrained portion of the C cycle that hereby would be constrained for the EAS.

The project works with 5 pilot projects. These pilots are all areas facing droughts,  floods or forest fires. Partners are looking for solutions for these specific areas, which will serve as examples for areas in Europe facing similar problems. The solutions found will be shared so that they can be implemented all over Europe. 
FACTS will help regions of Europe work together to share experience and good practice in the areas of innovation, the knowledge economy, the environment and risk prevention.  The common objective is to deliver lessons in the following three principles

The need to collect long-term data sets has been stressed by marine ecologists because such data provide baselines to verify trends in the structure and dynamics of marine communities. Long-term approaches produce meaningful data, essential for the successful management of marine ecosystems and their conservation.
Therefore, the aim of this proposal is to study the ecological structure and dynamics of Mediterranean littoral rocky benthic communities highly diverse and characterized by sessile long-lived species and low dynamics. These communities are considered particularly sensitive to climate change. This proposal attempts to integrate complementary approaches to enhance our ecological knowledge on marine benthos and their potential changes triggered by climate change. The proposed project will focus on 
- the analysis of structure and dynamics of benthic communities over long-term periods by analysing demographic traits of representative species and applying landscape ecology,
- the study of population genetics of these species and the correlation of genetic frequencies with the spatial distances within the current landscape.
The combination of photographic series, spatial statistics, geographical information systems and molecular markers will enable a better understanding on processes at finer spatial scales. The scientific knowledge gained in this proposal will substantially help to understand and predict trajectories of benthic littoral communities at different temporal and spatial scales driven by global warming and will contribute to better inform and advice strategies for biological conservation.

 Four deliverables were written. The deliverable on Habitat preferences of selected indicators resulted in 10-point habitat ranking of 128 taxa indicative for lowland streams. deliverable 95 dealt with reducing habitat dynamic by taking restoration measures. Five measures were tested and all resulted in dynamic reduction and biodiversity increase though the measure of discharge dynamics reduction caused the far best results. Deliverable 99 provided a brief description of the survey results of the foregoing years. Deliverable 94 included the habitat preference analyses for macroinvertebrates collected all over Europe. Along with a method development a number of European taxa was provided autecological information on substrate preferences. All results add to the knowledge development on the interaction between discharge patterns, substrate dynamics and macroinvertebrate responses.

To achieve the objectives stated above, the applicant will collaborate with major national authorities and researchers that deal with agriculture, air quality and energy issues in Cyprus.  As these topics have not been adequately addressed for any Mediterranean country up to now, the project''s multidisciplinary approach will improve knowledge for this region in general and can contribute to the advance of similar analyses in other South European countries.

There exists significant diversity in methodological approaches and terminology in cost assessments of different natural hazards and in different impacted sectors. ConHaz provides insight into cost assessment methods, which is needed for an integrated planning and overall budgeting, and to prioritise policies. To strengthen the role of cost assessments in natural hazard management and adaptation planning, existing approaches and best practices as well as knowledge gaps are identified. ConHaz has three key objectives.

ConHaz also considers various impacted economic sectors such as housing, industry and transport, and non-economic sectors such as health and nature. It will consider single and multi-hazards, leading to direct, indirect and intangible costs.  ConHaz moreover looks at costs and benefits of risk-prevention and emergency response policies. 
* Evaluation of compiled methods. The analysis addresses theoretical issues, such as the principal assumptions that underlie economic valuation of damage types, as well as practical issues, such as the qualifications needed for data collection and quality assurance. ConHaz also looks at the reliability of the end result by considering the accuracy of cost predictions and best-practice-methods of validation.

* What should we be willing to give up to reduce these risks? 
* What is the best timing for action? 
* How should the risk evaluation be adapted to the absence of objective probabilities, the conflicts between and biases in individual beliefs, the heterogeneity of individual preferences towards these risks, the ability to predict future impacts, the limited capability to share risk efficiently, or the changing expectations about long-term economic growth and about the scarcity of environmental resources? 

To examine these questions, we will combine various approaches from modern decision theory, the theory of finance, environmental economics and behavioural economics. 

 This research aims at helping collective decision making by improving the standard tools of benefit-cost analysis for the specificities of long-term risks: discounting of far distant effects, risk premium for fat tails, ambiguity premium, aggregation rules for heterogeneous beliefs and preferences, and option values. We will translate general concepts as sustainable development, corporate social responsibility and precautionary principle into efficient guidelines for collective decision making.

It raises several ethical issues in terms of intergenerational equity and global justice. Standard cost-benefit analysis neglects inequalities, assuming that appropriate redistributions are possible, but such redistributions are unlikely at the large temporal and regional scales involved in climate change issues. Hence it is of particular importance to develop evaluation methods to assess the distributional impact of climate policies. 
There are several challenges that must be met to develop such methods. A first problem is the question of discounting. Standard discounting methods violate intergenerational equity. Deriving an index of intergenerational equity that accounts for discounting is therefore a theoretical challenge. 
A second issue is that the policies under consideration have uncertain consequences, because the exact value of the parameters in the climate model are not known for sure. Hence inequalities between regions are uncertain and uncertainties are unevenly distributed among regions. 

These phenomena, which have largely been overlooked so far, seem particularly relevant for policy-making. One aim of the proposed research project is to to develop new evaluation methods to assess intergenerational and risk inequalities. To do so, we can rely on recent developments in decision and welfare theories. At the same time, the project aims at showing the relevance of the proposed methods.  For this purpose, we will rely on the CWS climate-economy integrated assessment model, that will have to be adapted to take into account risks and adaptation policies. This would be the occasion to deepen our knowledge of the relative merits of alternative policies aiming at reducing or mitigating the effects of greenhouse gas emissions, especially in terms of inequality. The wider long-term objective will be to improve policy evaluation and to help decision-making. Co-benefits - Adaptation and mitigation

A prime example is the Earth''s climate. Complex climate models are used to compute the climate change in response to expected changes in the composition of the atmosphere due to man-made emissions. Years of research have improved the ability to simulate the climate of the recent past but these models are still far from perfect. The model projections of the globally averaged temperature increase by the end of this century differ by as much as a factor of two, and differ completely in regard to projections for specific regions of the globe. Current practice commonly averages the predictions of the separate models. Our proposed approach is instead to form a consensus by combining the models into one super model. The super model has learned from past observations how to optimally exchange information among individual models at every moment in time. 
Results in nonlinear dynamics suggest that the models can be made to synchronize with each other even if only a small amount of information is exchanged, forming a consensus that best represents reality. This innovative approach to reduce uncertainty might be compared to a group of scientists resolving their differences through dialogue, rather than simply voting or averaging their opinions. Experts from non-linear dynamics, machine-learning and climate science are brought together within SUMO to produce a climate change simulation with a super model combining state-of-the-art climate models.  The super-modelling concept has the potential to provide improved estimates of global and regional climate change, so as to motivate and inform policy decisions. The approach is applicable in other situations where a small number of alternative models exist of the same real-world complex system, as in economy, ecology or biology. Climate models

The theme of WCC-3 is Climate prediction and information for decision-making , focusing on the application of climate information and predictions to societal problems enabling adaptation to the current climate conditions and predicted future changes in areas such as agriculture, forestry, water, health, infrastructure, urban cities and sustainable development. The involvement and participation of scientists from developing and least developed countries, which are often affected by climate related disasters and endowed with unique opportunities for development, shall help in developing appropriate climate services that would support the various sectors of the economy to spur growth. 
 The expected outcomes from WCC-3 are:
* Greatly increased understanding of the scientific and practical issues involved in the implementation of improved global, regional and national arrangements for the provision and application of climate services; and
* A shared understanding of a strategy for implementing a new Global Framework for Climate Services. 
* Establish an international framework that will enhance the provision, exchange, and application of climate prediction and information services for a wide range of socio-economic sectors and in doing so make a significant contribution to the UNFCCC COP15. Awareness raising

* developing a comprehensive modelling framework for predicting the dynamics of services provided by major European terrestrial ecosystems at a regional scale. 
* developing macro-scale indicators of society''s adaptive capacity to changes in ecosystem service provision. 
* developing a range of scenarios for socio-economic development, land-use change, pollution levels, atmospheric composition and climate change up to the year 2100. 
* maintaining a continuous dialogue with stakeholders to ensure the applicability of results for the management of natural resources.

* To investigate the dimensions, distribution and interconnection of deep-sea ecosystems; 
* To understand changes in deep-sea ecosystems related to key factors including climate change, human impacts and the impact of large-scale episodic events; 
* To understand the biological capacities and specific adaptations of deep-sea organisms, and investigate the importance of biodiversity in the functioning of deep-water ecosystems; 
* To provide stakeholders and policymakers with scientific knowledge to support deep-sea governance aimed at the sustainable management of resources and the conservation of ecosystems. 
 HERMIONE study sites include the Arctic, North Atlantic and Mediterranean and cover a range of ecosystems including cold-water corals, canyons, cold and hot seeps, seamounts and open slopes and deep basins. The project will make strong connections between deep-sea science and user needs. HERMIONE will enhance the education and public perception of the deep-ocean issues through some of the major European aquaria. A major aim of the project is to create a platform for discussion between a range of stakeholders, and contribute to EU environmental policies.

(DE) QUAAS J no information available FP 7 All level (European, national, regional, local) Climate change is probably the most important challenge facing mankind. Our understanding of the climate system and ability to make projections about its future evolution are based almost exclusively on global climate models. Although climate models have shown remarkable improvement in recent years, their projections are still subject to large uncertainties. It is well established that clouds are the weakest link in climate simulations. The poor representation of the many cloud-related processes such as precipitation, aerosol indirect effects, and cloud-radiation interactions is the major source of uncertainty in climate models. Fortunately, a treasure trove of measurements from a new generation of earth observing satellites has become available in recent years. The aim of this proposal is to significantly improve the representation of clouds in the global climate model of the Max Planck Institute for Meteorology by tapping into this large remote sensing data set. In particular, we propose to develop a statistical approach based on probability density functions to better describe subgrid-scale cloud processes such as horizontal and vertical cloud variability, and convection.  It is expected that this effort will have resulted in substantially improved climate change projections by the time of the Fifth Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, currently scheduled to be prepared in the 2010-2013 period.

We will improve the quantitative understanding of key biogeochemical and physical processes through a combination of observations and models. We will upscale new process understanding to large-scale integrative feedbacks of the ocean carbon cycle to climate change and rising carbon dioxide concentrations. We will quantify the vulnerability of the ocean carbon sources and sinks in a probabilistic sense using cutting edge coupled Earth system models under a spectrum of emission scenarios including climate stabilisation scenarios as required for the 5th IPCC assessment report. The drivers for the vulnerabilities will be identified. The most actual observations of the changing ocean carbon sink will be systematically integrated with the newest ocean carbon models, a coupled land-ocean model, an Earth system model of intermediate complexity, and fully fledged Earth system models through a spectrum of data assimilation methods as well as advanced performance assessment tools.  Results will be optimal process descriptions and most realistic error margins for future ocean carbon uptake quantifications with models under the presently available observational evidence. The project will deliver calibrated future evolutions of ocean pH and carbonate saturation as required by the research community on ocean acidification in the EU project EPOCA and further projects in this field. The time history of atmosphere-ocean carbon fluxes past, present, and future will be synthesised globally as well as regionally for the transcontinental RECCAP project.
