•to address and reduce deficiencies in projections of future climate change;
•to quantify our confidence and the uncertainties in predictions of future climate and its impacts, using an array of climate models and impact models and expert judgment on their performance;
•to interpret these results in relation to European policies for adapting to or mitigating climate change.
PRUDENCE is part of a co-operative cluster of projects exploring future changes in extreme events in response to global warming. The other members of the cluster are MICE (Modelling the Impact of Climate Extremes) and STARDEX (Statistical and Regional Dynamic downscaling of Extremes for European regions). This research is highly relevant to current climate related problems in Europe. PRUDENCE will provide a series of high-resolution climate change scenarios for 2071-2100 for Europe, characterising the variability and level of confidence in these scenarios as a function of uncertainties in model formulation, natural/internal climate variability, and alternative scenarios of future atmospheric composition. The project will provide a quantitative assessment of the risks arising from changes in regional weather and climate in different parts of Europe, by estimating future changes in extreme events such as flooding and windstorms and by providing a robust estimation of the likelihood and magnitude of such changes. The project will also examine the uncertainties in potential impacts induced by the range of climate scenarios developed from the climate modelling results. This will provide useful information for climate modellers on the levels of accuracy in climate scenarios required by impact analysts. Furthermore, a better appreciation of the uncertainty range in calculations of future impacts from climate change may offer new insights into the scope for adaptation and mitigation responses to climate change. In order to facilitate this exchange of new information, the PRUDENCE work plan places emphasis on the wide dissemination of results and preparation of a non-technical project summary aimed at policy makers and other interested parties.

This question is however of great interest for the biodiversity of alpine ecotones, and changes in the treeline would have important implications for the global carbon cycle. Thus, there is a need to understand the mechanisms shaping treelines and how different factors operate on them both at local and landscape scales.

The future status of freshwater ecosystems is however, also dependent on changes in land-use, pollution loading and water demand. In addition the measures that need to be taken to restore freshwater ecosystems to good ecological health or to sustain priority species as required by EU Directives need to be designed either to adapt to future climate change or to mitigate the effects of climate change in the context of changing land-use. Generating the scientific understanding that enables such measures to be implemented successfully is the principal focus of REFRESH. 

The focus is on three principal climate-related and interacting pressures, increasing temperature, changes in water levels and flow regimes and excess nutrients, primarily with respect to lowland rivers, lakes and wetlands because these often pose the most difficult problems in meeting both the requirements of the WFD and Habitats Directive. 
REFRESH will advance our fundamental and applied science in 5 key areas: 
- Understanding how the functioning of freshwater ecosystems is affected by climate change 
- New indicators of functional response and tools for assessing vulnerability 
- Modelling ecological processes 
- Integrated modelling 
- Adaptive management. REFRESH is concerned with the development of a system that will enable water managers to design cost-effective restoration programmes for freshwater ecosystems at the local and catchment scales that account for the expected future impacts of climate change and land-use change in the context of the WFD and Habitats Directive.

The scientific work packages in SafeLand are organized in five Areas:
Area 1 focuses on improving the knowledge on triggering mechanisms, processes and thresholds, including climate-related and anthropogenic triggers, and on run-out models in landslide hazard assessment;
Area 2 does an harmonisation of quantitative risk assessment methodologies for different spatial scales, looking into uncertainties, vulnerability, landslide susceptibility, landslide frequency, and identifying hotspots in Europe with higher landslide hazard and risk;
Area 3 focuses on future climate change scenarios and changes in demography and infrastructure, resulting in the evolution of hazard and risk in Europe at selected hotspots;
Area 4 addresses the technical and practical issues related to monitoring and early warning for landslides, and identifies the best technologies available both in the context of hazard assessment and in the context of design of early warning systems;
Area 5 provides a toolbox of risk mitigation strategies and guidelines for choosing the most appropriate risk management strategy.
Maintaining the database of case studies, dissemination of the project results, and project management and coordination are defined in work packages 6, 7 and 8.

- In Task 3 new probabilistic scenarios for urban areas that are consistent with UKCIP08 will be developed. 
- Task 4 will model the relationship between climate impacts and the urban economy, in order to identify how the economy may be disrupted by climate change. By analysing change in the economy through time and interactions between economic sectors, we will understand better how the urban economy can be made more resilient.
- Task 5 will combine the economic model developed in Task 4 with a new model of the spatial planning of buildings and infrastructure in urban areas. As well as identifying concentrations of vulnerability, this will enable the simulation of potential redesign of the built environment under different scenarios of climate and other drivers such as employment and changes to the transport system.

- Can aerosol pollution in the Mediterranean region exacerbate the predicted and observed drying in a changing climate? 

 We have developed a new numerical method to consistently compute atmospheric trace gas and aerosol chemistry and cloud processes. The method is computationally efficient so that it can be used in climate models. For the first time cloud droplet formation on multi-component particles can be represented based on first principles rather than parameterisations. This allows for a direct coupling in models between aerosol chemical composition and the continuum between hazes and clouds as a function of ambient relative humidity. We will apply the method in a new nested global-limited area model system to study atmospheric chemistry climate interactions and anthropogenic influences. We will focus on the Mediterranean region because it is a hot spot in climate change exposed to drying and air pollution. The limited area model will also be applied as cloud-resolving model to study aerosol influences on precipitation and storm development.

The project contains several complementary investigations like geophysical surveys, microclimatic investigations, numerical modeling of permafrost distribution and physical modeling of permafrost related slope instability. 

 The first results (Harris et al. 2003) showed that the thermal permafrost gradients are consistent with the 20th century surface warming. Important to notice is further the uniqueness of the thermal profile at each site, which has a huge impact on risk assessment and related investigations required for determining the site specific features. For example, each thermal profile indicates a site specific depth of the lowest temperature as well as different permafrost temperatures and active layer depths. Factors influencing the thermal profiles are geothermal heat flux (warming the permafrost at its bottom), variations in lithology, the ground surface temperature and past changes of surface temperatures as well (Harris et al. 2003). Therefore, a big difficulty in predicting future permafrost changes is that the permafrost/thermal relationship is not in equilibrium, rather it is in part a function of the climate over the last decades and centuries (Harris et al. 2005).', 'P', 'Co-benefits - Adaptation and mitigation', 'http://books.google.at/books?id=Zwh-YaVnoHMC&pg=PA71&lpg=PA71&dq=Permafrost+and+climate+in+Europe+-+climate+change,+mountain+permafrost+degradation+and+geotechnical+hazard&source=bl&ots=UGz7RYFIkx&sig=ImTOnXe8Zg-p4K4Z9l_nl8put6A&hl=de&ei=u5_4TIHSHZHNswa7n', '12/1997-no information');

First, a comparative assessment of the effect of temperature on parasite population and community structure dynamics will be carried out using matched pairs control-impact design in a natural experiment setup to test the parasite numerical response hypothesis. Simultaneously, structural patterns in a free-living freshwater system, macrozoobentic communities, will be evaluated. Secondly, using the same sampling design the hypothesis of temperature-mediated alteration of pollutant metabolism will be tested by a comparative evaluation of the rates of toxic metal accumulation in selected dominant parasite and benthic invertebrate species. Identification of temporal and spatial patterns of abundance and community structure at different thermal regimes is the key to forecast the impacts of climate change on parasite communities in fish in European freshwater ecosystems. Further, linking ecological data to pollutant metabolism will provide novel insights on the response of parasite communities to environmental change which may help predict possible outcomes of host-parasite interaction and forecast minimum index values to detect pollution in the context of the effect of global warming.  The novelty of the proposed research lies in its trans-disciplinary approach linking advanced ecology and ecotoxicology concepts and methods. The quantification of the response to increased ambient temperature of the model organism groups relates not solely to issues fundamental to assessment of climate-mediated community level alterations and host-parasite interactions but to wider conceptual and applied domains such as synergism and/or antagonism among multiple stressors and pollution risk analysis using model indicator systems.', 'V; O', 'Impact assessment and indicator

Increased freshwater discharge to the oceans also impacts ocean circulation as well as the Arctic Hydrological Cycle.
These changes are happening more rapidly than predicted. In order to be able to foresee future sea level rise, it is necessary to strive for a better understanding of glaciological processes, and to include them in Earth System Models.
The NCoE SVALI takes on the task to answer these key questions:
How fast is land ice volume in the Arctic and North-Atlantic area changing, and why? 
Will these processes continue to accelerate? 
What are the consequences for sea-level and ocean circulation 
What are the implications for society?', 'O; V', '', NULL, '');

Models predict a 44% increase in forest fires annually in America with a 61% increase in Canada, whilst fire seasons in boreal, temperate and Mediterranean regions will be prolonged in response to global warming. However, most predictions are based on outputs from numerical models and observed links between global warming and fire activity are essential for assessing future fire risk. This research will provide such sorely needed data by studying periods of past climate change in Earth history. Project FILE will focus on 3 key warming events: the mid-Pliocene (~3.3 million years ago (Ma)), the Palaeocene-Eocene Thermal Maximum (~55 Ma) and the Triassic-Jurassic Boundary (~200 Ma). Relationships between global warming and fire activity will be examined by: (1) compiling records of ancient fire activity using fossil charcoal abundance; (2) linking fire activity to records of vegetation change across these events; (3) assessing changes in vegetation for their flammable properties. The size, shape, density and connectivity of fossil leaves will be quantified, as these characters are known to control flammability. Modern analogues of the ancient plants will be subject to combustion experiments using state-of-the-art fire propagation apparatus. These experiments will test for differences in flammability between ecologically dominant plants, and will be undertaken in both modern and ancient atmospheric gas compositions.

The climate impact of various transport modes (land surface, shipping, aviation) will be assessed, including those of long-lived greenhouse gases like CO2 and N2O, and in particular the effects of emissions of ozone precursors and particles, as well as of contrails and ship tracks. The project goal includes the provision of forecasts and other policy-relevant advice, which will be supplied to governments and to international assessments of climate change and ozone depletion, such as the IPCC reports (Kyoto Protocol) and WMO-UNEP ozone assessments (Montreal Protocol). Using significantly improved transport emission inventories, better evaluated and hence more reliable models, these new forecasts in QUANTIFY will represent a considerable improvement of current predictions. Long time scales are involved in the transport system and its effects on climate: Some transportation modes have long development and in-service times; some emissions have long residence times and the thermal inertia of the climate system is protracted. The impact of short-lived species, however, depends on location and time of the emissions.  So several transport scenarios and potential mitigation options need to be assessed on a sound common basis to identify the most effective combination of short and long-term measures and to inform policymakers and industry. We aim to provide such guidance by focused field measurements, exploitation of existing data, a range of numerical models, and new policy-relevant metrics of climate change. To achieve the goal, several advances in our fundamental understanding of atmospheric processes will be required such as the mechanisms by which pollutants are transported from exhaust into the free atmosphere, the impact of pollutants on clouds and the role of absorbing aerosols.', 'P', 'Co-benefits - Adaptation and mitigation

One of the main goals are to deepen our understanding of the relative merits of these fuels’ value chains, between which we could expect that the actual competition will take place as the market gets more mature. 

This proposal intends to systematically investigate the performance of second-generation bio-fuels. A test facility will be developed for parallel studies of different bio-fuels in various state-of-the-art engines provided by the industrial partners. This enables a direct comparative study of the obtained results. 

Furthermore, theoretical investigation will be carried out to deepen the fundamental understanding of the thermo-chemical processes involved. This involves adaption of simulation tools for prediction of combustion and emission formation, to support further technological development

Key objectives of the project
Differences between the properties of conventional petroleum fuels and bio-fuels significantly affect three critical areas associated with usage in practical applications (car, heavy duty, and industrial engines): engine combustion, performance and emissions. Therefore, the objectives are:
- to deepen the understanding of combustion of bio-fuels. Second-generation bio-fuels from Nordic feedstock, DME, F-T fuels and low level blending of methanol in gasoline will be primary focus fuels.
- to investigate the effect of bio-fuel on engine performance including power output, fuel economy, emissions, and engine durability (tribology).
- to develop a NOx-smoke emissions reduction strategy, which can enable bio-fuels to be used with confidence in a wide range of future applications where compression ignition (diesel) engines are utilized.
- to contribute to educational training and transfer of knowledge through PhD studentships and MSc projects.
The different fuels and their overall performance will be evaluated with a view to the ability to address European standard EURO5 and EURO6 emission regulations.', 'M', '', NULL, '2010-2013');

SUDPLAN from the end-users perspective
The end-users of the SUDPLAN services are city planners who can either work directly in the system or they can use different kinds of scientific users – IT, environmental modellers, statisticians etc – to support them. End-users will be able to evaluate risk hazards of storm water local runoff, river flooding and elevated air pollution levels for planned or existing urban areas subject to a changing climate.

SUDPLAN services will be demonstrated for four city pilots: Stockholm, Wuppertal, Linz and Prague. However, whatever European city may access the same Common Services as the pilots and they can also develop own local applications.


 The SUDPLAN project - Sustainable Urban Development Planner for Climate Change Adaptation - will develop a web-based planning, prediction and training tool to support decisions in long term urban planning. This will help to assure population´s health, comfort, safety and life quality as well as sustainability of investments in utilities and infrastructures within a changing climate. With it´s open nature and architectural design, SUDPLAN will contribute to a shared information space in Europe.', 'O', 'Adaptation measures/responses

The primary objective is to provide an integrated methodology for planning sustainable defence strategies for the management of coastal erosion and flooding which addresses technical, social, economic and environmental aspects. THESEUS objectives are governed by three specific goals, which concern: (a) Risk assessment, (b) Response strategies and (c) Application.

 To integrate the best of these technical measures in a strategic policy context we will develop overarching THESEUS guidelines which will considers the environmental, social and economic issues raised in any coastal area. It is in this spirit that THESEUS will advance European and international experience in applying innovative technologies to reducing coastal risks. THESEUS activities will be carried out within a multidisciplinary framework using 8 study sites across Europe, with specific attention to the most vulnerable coastal environments such as deltas, estuaries and wetlands, where many large cities and industrial areas are located.

Recent droughts observed in these basins call for the need of an efficient technology to predict medium and long-term flows for sustainable water resources management. The project developed appropriate mathematical models to represent snow-pack dynamics and snowmelt runoff. These models are expressly designed to integrate Earth Observation data and in-situ hydrological and meteorological measurements, introducing therefore a novel approach to the representation of the involved physical pro cesses in time and space. Model innovation stems with the enhanced capability of Earth Observation data to provide continuous information on state variables, that can be poorly accounted for using the traditional approach based on input-output control. Model calibration, validation and demonstration was performed for representative catchments of different geographic conditions (climate, geology, geomorphology, hydrography) in the European Alps. Models were implemented in a geo-service for tailoring data and models to different environments under an integrated, but modulated approach capable of effective addressing the specific problems raising from different stakeholders, these including water policy makers, economic (hydropower companies, irrigation schemes, municipal water supply), and social (regional, basin and municipal authorities, citizens) stakeholders.

The objective will be achieved by: a) defining economic, environmental and social sustainability indicators, b) developing a tool for Sustainability Impact Assessment by integrating a set of models, c) supplying the tool with real data, aggregated as needed and appropriate, d) testing the tool in a stepwise procedure allowing adjustments to be made according to the experiences gained, e) applying the tool to assess the sustainability of the present European FWC (and subsets thereof) as well the impacts of potential major changes based on scenarios, f) making the adapted versions of the tool available to stakeholder groupings (industrial, political and others).The multi-functionality of the FWC is taken into account by using indicators to assess the sustainability of production processes and by including in the analysis the various products and services of the FWC. Wide stakeholder consultations will be used throughout the process to reach the objective. EFORWOOD will contribute to EU policies connected to the FWC, especially to the Sustainable Development Strategy. It will provide policy-makers, forest owners, the related industries and other stakeholders with a tool to strengthen the forest-based sector''s contribution towards a more sustainable Europe, thereby also improving its competitiveness. To achieve this, EFORWOOD gathers a consortium of highest-class experts, including the most representative forest-based sector confederations.', 'M', '', NULL, '');

Implementation of European policies designed to promote and protect multifunctional land use requires the urgent development of robust tools for the assessment of different scenarios'' impacts on the environmental and socio-economic sustainability. The technical objective of SENSOR is to build, validate and implement sustainability impact assessment tools (SIAT), including databases and spatial reference frameworks for the analysis of land and human resources in the context of agricultural, regional and environmental policies. The scientific challenge is to establish relationships between different environmental and socio-economic processes as characterised by indicators considered to be quantitative measures of sustainability. Scenario techniques will be used within an integrated modelling framework, reflecting various aspects of multifunctionality and their interactions. The focus will be on European sensitive regions, particularly those in accession countries, since accession poses significant questions for policy makers regarding the socio-economic and environmental effect of existing and proposed land use policies. SIAT will utilise the statistical and spatial data continuously collected by European and regional agencies. SENSOR will deliver novel solutions for integrated modelling, spatial and temporal scaling and aggregation of data, selection of indicators, database management, analysis and prediction of trends, education and implementation. SIAT will be made available to decision makers at the European and regional level, providing user-friendly interfaces and scientifically sound procedures for the assessment of environmental and monetary responses of policy options. Cost-benefit and cost-effectiveness analysis of policy implementation will be an integral part of the SIAT''s functions. (cordis)', 'E', '', NULL, '');

Our understanding of the climate system and ability to make projections about its future evolution are based almost exclusively on global climate models. Although climate models have shown remarkable improvement in recent years, their projections are still subject to large uncertainties. It is well established that clouds are the weakest link in climate simulations. The poor representation of the many cloud-related processes such as precipitation, aerosol indirect effects, and cloud-radiation interactions is the major source of uncertainty in climate models. Fortunately, a treasure trove of measurements from a new generation of earth observing satellites has become available in recent years. The aim of this proposal is to significantly improve the representation of clouds in the global climate model of the Max Planck Institute for Meteorology by tapping into this large remote sensing data set. In particular, we propose to develop a statistical approach based on probability density functions to better describe subgrid-scale cloud processes such as horizontal and vertical cloud variability, and convection.  It is expected that this effort will have resulted in substantially improved climate change projections by the time of the Fifth Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, currently scheduled to be prepared in the 2010-2013 period.', 'O', 'Climate models', 'http://cordis.europa.eu/fetch?CALLER=FP7_PROJ_EN&ACTION=D&DOC=324&CAT=PROJ&QUERY=012c5238d53a:4d69:27aea545&RCN=89612', '09/2007 - 08/2011');

It raises several ethical issues in terms of intergenerational equity and global justice. Standard cost-benefit analysis neglects inequalities, assuming that appropriate redistributions are possible, but such redistributions are unlikely at the large temporal and regional scales involved in climate change issues. Hence it is of particular importance to develop evaluation methods to assess the distributional impact of climate policies. 
There are several challenges that must be met to develop such methods. A first problem is the question of discounting. Standard discounting methods violate intergenerational equity. Deriving an index of intergenerational equity that accounts for discounting is therefore a theoretical challenge. 
A second issue is that the policies under consideration have uncertain consequences, because the exact value of the parameters in the climate model are not known for sure. Hence inequalities between regions are uncertain and uncertainties are unevenly distributed among regions. 

These phenomena, which have largely been overlooked so far, seem particularly relevant for policy-making. One aim of the proposed research project is to to develop new evaluation methods to assess intergenerational and risk inequalities. To do so, we can rely on recent developments in decision and welfare theories. At the same time, the project aims at showing the relevance of the proposed methods.  For this purpose, we will rely on the CWS climate-economy integrated assessment model, that will have to be adapted to take into account risks and adaptation policies. This would be the occasion to deepen our knowledge of the relative merits of alternative policies aiming at reducing or mitigating the effects of greenhouse gas emissions, especially in terms of inequality.

A prime example is the Earth''s climate. Complex climate models are used to compute the climate change in response to expected changes in the composition of the atmosphere due to man-made emissions. Years of research have improved the ability to simulate the climate of the recent past but these models are still far from perfect. The model projections of the globally averaged temperature increase by the end of this century differ by as much as a factor of two, and differ completely in regard to projections for specific regions of the globe. Current practice commonly averages the predictions of the separate models. Our proposed approach is instead to form a consensus by combining the models into one super model. The super model has learned from past observations how to optimally exchange information among individual models at every moment in time. 
Results in nonlinear dynamics suggest that the models can be made to synchronize with each other even if only a small amount of information is exchanged, forming a consensus that best represents reality. This innovative approach to reduce uncertainty might be compared to a group of scientists resolving their differences through dialogue, rather than simply voting or averaging their opinions. Experts from non-linear dynamics, machine-learning and climate science are brought together within SUMO to produce a climate change simulation with a super model combining state-of-the-art climate models.  The super-modelling concept has the potential to provide improved estimates of global and regional climate change, so as to motivate and inform policy decisions.

Main research areas
The degree of vulnerability of different types of European regions to climate change; the
impact of variations in different individual climate change parameters on these regions in
economic, social, and environmental terms as well as the adaptive capacities of these regions
and their further enhancement.
Territorial potentials for the mitigation of climate change in different types of European regions
(in relation to e.g. renewable energy, carbon sinks, energy saving).
Potentially new types of regions emerging as a consequence of climate change, revealing the
same characteristics regarding their adaptation and their mitigation capacities and the
interdependencies among different types of European regions.
The effects of climate change on different sectors of regional and local economies and
regional and local infrastructures, the impacts on regional water management.
Social and cultural implications of the aforementioned possible developments (e.g. regarding
employment, standards of living and welfare in different regions), possible effects on migration
within and/or from outside Europe both, in the short and long term as well as the likely effects
for different types of regions.
Potential new development opportunities for European regions through adaptation and/or
mitigation, their exploitation to achieve more competitiveness on regional and European scale.
Mitigation and adaptation measures to be applied in the different types of European regions to

There is a large interest of using bioethanol as a transportation fuel, however, using raw materials that compete with food production is not a sustainable and acceptable solution. Therefore we will work with the 2nd generation biofuels, making use of lignocellulosic raw materials. To meet the requirement of an economically feasible process, we will develop the process towards high gravity, i.e. operating at as high raw material concentrations as possible. Biobutanol is an alternative to bioethanol that has received increasing attention in later years, due to that it has several advantages over bioethanol, however, its production via a fermentation pathway faces a number of challenges. In the project we will develop and compare ethanol produced via a high gravity path with butanol production using bacteria and yeast. Life cycle analsysis will be used to assess the environmental performances. The focus area will be to optimise the enzymatic hydrolysis and the fermentation process. i.e. how are these two process steps interacting and integrated in a high gravity process. In addition, the project aims at solving and understanding fundamental challenges that arise when operating at high gravity. 

Project goals
The major objectives and deliverables in the project are: 
- Advance the technology for production of 2nd generation liquid biofuels (ethanol and butanol) at very high gravity by improving process integration, hydrolysis procedures, developing novel robust fermentation organisms and optimising fermentation conditions 
- Expand the knowledge-base on yeast and bacterial growth and physiology under industrially relevant (and challenging) conditions using various Nordic lignocellulosic feedstocks. Both Nordic wood and agriculture residues pretreated with hydrothermal pretreatment and steam pretreatment will be used.
- Use LCA as a tool to evaluate, from an environmental point of view (i) yeast based ethanol production under high gravity conditions and (ii) to assess research steps necessary to make butanol conceivable as a biofuel in addition to ethanol.', 'M', '', NULL, '');

Among the most apparent effects of climate change are alterations in the phenology of many species as a result of changes in the timing of seasons. One of the most striking examples concerns the life-cycle of migratory birds: during recent decades a growing number of studies have reported a direct relationship between climate change and bird migration phenology, essentially showing that birds arrive earlier to their breeding grounds in the Northern Hemisphere, in accordance with a trend towards higher global temperature. However, the ultimate mechanisms by which these phenol-typical adaptations occur are poorly understood. Two contrasting, non-exclusive, mechanisms may account for the observed responses: a micro-evolutionary response to selection and/or phenotypic plasticity. To explore which of these mechanisms operates and when, here we propose the combined use of long-term datasets of individually-marked migratory birds, their phenotypic and life-history traits and their fitness parameters, along with climatic data and pedigree information. We propose to identify which phenotypic traits have changed over time because of the influence of climate change, by using a range of statistical analyses and mathematical modelling (capture-mark-recapture methods, linear mixed modelling).

Second, we will test predictions concerning the resistance and resilience of SADs by a comparative analysis of existing data sets (that encompass communities in terrestrial, freshwater and marine environments for ecosystems extending from the poles to the tropics) and through a new field experiment that quantifies temporal turnover across a community (unicellular organisms to vertebrates) in relation to factors both natural (dispersal limitation) and anthropogenic (human disturbance) thought to shape SADs. In the final part of the project we will apply these new insights into the temporal dynamics of SADs to two important conservation challenges. These are 1) the conservation of biodiversity in a heavily utilized European landscape (Fife, Scotland) and 2) the conservation of biodiversity in Mamirauá and Amaña reserves in Amazonian flooded forest.  Taken together this research will not only shed new light on the structure of ecological communities but will also aid conservation.', 'O; V', 'Adaptive capacity Awareness raising Adaptation strategy Impact assessment a', 'http://cordis.europa.eu/fetch?CALLER=FP7_PROJ_EN&ACTION=D&DOC=34&CAT=PROJ&QUERY=012c3a84d540:e129:6bf95e5b&RCN=94849', '08/2010 - 07/2015');

Impacts on the disturbance regime are particularly relevant in this regard. In a sound science-based sustainable forest management/ ecosystem management approach (SFEM) potential changes in climate and disturbance regimes need to be considered explicitly. Disturbance dynamics, however, are still poorly understood especially in ecosystems with interacting, climate-sensitive disturbance agents. Currently, most available model approaches suffer either from a limited spatial extent to address large scale interacting disturbance regimes (i.e. stand models) or a coarse structural resolution with regard to the information needs in resource management (i.e. landscape models).
The objective of the proposed research is to bridge this gap in
(i) developing an individual-based landscape modeling framework;
(ii) adopting process-oriented disturbance modules and utilizing existing ecological understanding to model disturbance interactions, and
(iii) testing the model framework in two case studies in the temperate forest biome.
 To successfully address (interactions between) disturbances as emerging property of the modeled system as well as to provide relevant levels of information in the context of SFEM an individual-based, process-oriented landscape modeling approach is proposed. The development will bring together recent advances in forest landscape modeling with efficient algorithms of modeling individual-based tree competition and process-based production. Existing disturbance models for selected agents will be adopted focusing on interactions and climate sensitivity. The framework will be parameterized and evaluated in two cases studies in the Eastern Alps (Austria) and the Pacific Northwest (USA). Overall, the modeling framework aims at contributing to questions of SFEM under changing climate and disturbance regimes and facilitating a landscape perspective in forest resource management.', 'O', 'Adaptive management Impact assessment and indicator', 'http://iland.boku.ac.at/tiki-index.php', '04/2009 - 03/2012');

In addition, populations on separate high altitude areas will become increasingly fragmented and isolated from one-another as suitable habitat towards the lower end of their altitudinal range becomes unsuitable.
For many alpine specialists, mountain tops may be considered as islands separated by unsuitable habitat, and the size and spacing of these can greatly affect the regional occurrence of species. This project will determine the effects of high alpine habitat patch size and isolation on the abundance and species richness of different animal taxa (birds, butterflies and carabids, representing different dispersal abilities) by carrying out surveys in habitat patches representing a gradient of different sizes and levels of isolation, where patches are defined by the treeline and a range of high altitude species of open grassland habitats are surveyed.
Effects of fragmentation will be examined by analysing the relationship between species abundance/richness and patch size and isolation. Resulting statistical models will then be used to examine the potential consequences of climate change on alpine communities by considering differing scenarios of altitudinal shifts in vegetation zones.

To support policy and planning decisions that will help wildlife to adapt to climate change, BRANCH developed a ‘Decision testing framework’. This can be used to assess the adaptation measures or actions that are needed to help ‘future proof’ planning decisions.
For our coasts a transferable methodology was developed using baseline habitat surveys and habitat modelling (see Annex 3, Final report). In the UK for the South Coast, BRANCH partners assessed habitat distributions using Aerial Photographic Interpretation data at six sites. This data is freely available from Local Records Centres in the UK for the whole of the South East coast (see contacts page). Changes in the extent of intertidal habitat under sea-level rise were modelled for the next 80 years. Modelled outputs were then used to create visualisations of the sites. This visualisation methodology can be used by coastal managers to visualise changes in future coastal landscapes arising from future climate change. It was also tested for the first time at the Baie des Vaies in Normandy, France (see Chapter 7, Annex 3).
BRANCH carried out three terrestrial case studies. These informed adaptation strategies (see Annex 4, Final report, ) that planners can use to increase adaptation options for wildlife, including planning where to create new site for nature and improve ecological networks.

The project initially evaluates recent climate change scenarios, leading to predictions on the weather conditions in the future. Naturally, these may result in changes of the hydrological balance of the inland waterway network, being either associated with less ice formation and more balanced waterway conditions over the year or extreme situations such as prolonged low water periods or floods, depending on the region considered. The next step of the project is to evaluate the effect of these changes on the costs and reliability associated with inland waterway transport and other transport, which might lead to changes in transport flows. These calculations form the basis of a baseline scenario, assuming little or no deviation in policy related to IWT or other transport modes. In parallel with the construction of the reference scenario, we identify proper adaptation strategies for coping with possible climate change effects on IWT. We  assess them with respect to their applicability, implementation and costs.

The control principles incorporate knowledge of the wind flow variations, provide robustness by addressing reconfiguration and at the same time minimize the (extreme and fatigue) loads experienced by turbines.

The oceans exert a considerable influence on the atmosphere by absorbing a large fraction of GHGs, but there remain large uncertainties in the budget. This underscores the importance of conducting research concerned with air-sea gas fluxes in order to work toward a reduction in these uncertainties.
The scientific objectives of this proposal are to simultaneously measure the fluxes of climatically relevant compounds in both the coastal and oceanic marine atmospheric boundary layer. The proposed species are carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide, and carbon monoxide. All species will be detected at 1-10 Hz, which will allow for fluxes to be directly determined using the eddy correlation method. This proposed method takes advantage of recently-developed trace gas analyser (TGA) technology. The TGA will be deployed at the Mace Head Research Station where a time series over several years will be acquired. The system will also be deployed periodically on research ships to compare the magnitude of the fluxes in the coastal regions with open ocean data. If funded, this measurement will be one of the first of its kind deployed in the marine atmospheric boundary layer, and will provide an invaluable time series of the fluxes over an extended period.

 In situ measurements at UNESCO sites throughout Europe will allow a much more precise and integrated assessment of the real damage impact of climate change on cultural heritage. Appropriate sustainable mitigation/adaptation strategies, also from previous projects, are further developed and applied on the basis of these findings simultaneously. All these results will be incorporated into an assessment of the economic impacts. In order to ensure an efficient use of resources, this project will build on the results of already concluded EU research projects (Noah s Ark). The final achievement of the project will be a macro-economic impact report on cultural heritage in the times of climate change akin to the STERN report which would be a truly European contribution to future IPCC Reports.', 'O, P', 'Adaptation measures/responses  Adaptation strategy Impact assessment and in', 'http://www.climateforculture.eu/', '11/2009 - 10/2014');

To provide affirmative answers to these questions the proposal will as a first step identify and describe mechanisms by which a changing climate may affect the exposure of Arctic and other human populations to contaminants through change in chemical use and emissions, delivery to the arctic ecosystem as well as processing within the arctic physical environment and human food chain. This work relies on modelling of existing data. Secondly, the project will expand the existing knowledge database on human exposure to polybrominated biphenylethers, perfluorinated surfactants and phthalates by analyses of 1000 biobanked serum samples collected in a EU FP5 project. Thirdly, the project will increase the limited knowledge on links between human exposure to contaminants and reproductive health. 
 This work relies on a large existing parent-child-cohort, where a follow-up survey provide new data that are fed into risk assessment. Furthermore we will perform reviews of experimental and epidemiological literature to identify critical reproductive effects and exposure-response data for selected compounds as input to the risk assessment. Finally the project will integrate data on climate induced changes in contaminant mobility and distribution and links between contaminant exposure and reproductive health into a risk evaluation providing insight into possible future risk scenarios related to global climate change.

CLIME took advantage of automatic water quality monitoring systems already deployed on many of our target lakes. CLIME had a socio-economic component which paid particular attention to two water quality issues that are likely to become increasingly important:
   1. Leaching of highly coloured water from peatland catchments.
   2. Increased productivity of some lakes and the increasing frequency of algal blooms. CLIME also had a decision support component which developed an integrated climate - catchment - lake - socio-economy tool with a graphical interface and uncertainty analysis capability. The development of this CLIME DSS tool continues.
Also, in a related prject with JRC, a method and a website for illustrating the impacts of climate change on physical characteristics of lakes in Europe was developed.
