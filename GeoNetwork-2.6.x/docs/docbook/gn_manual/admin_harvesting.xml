        <title>Harvesting</title>
        <section>
            <title>Introduction</title>
            <para>Since the beginning of the project, there has been the need to share metadata
                among several GeoNetwork nodes. Usually, each node takes care of a region of
                interest so it is important to be able to perform a search over all these nodes at
                the same time. This is called distributed search and exploits the Internet
                connectivity. In our cases, this distributed search can be heavy to perform if there
                are many maps with associated thumbnails. Furthermore, GeoNetwork is usually
                employed in areas (like Africa, Asia) where the connectivity can be limited, making
                the use of distributed search not feasible.</para>
            <para>Harvesting is the process of collecting remote metadata and storing them
                locally for a faster access. This is a periodic process to do, for example, once a
                week. Harvesting is not a simple import: local and remote metadata are kept aligned.
                Using some <emphasis>magic</emphasis>, one GeoNetwork node is capable of discovering metadata
                that have been added, removed or updated in the remote node.</para>
            <para>GeoNetwork is able to harvest from the following sources (for more details see
                below):</para>

        <section>
            <title>Mechanism overview</title>
            <para>The harvesting mechanism is based on the concept of a <emphasis>universally unique identifier 
                (<glossterm linkend="glos-uuid">UUID</glossterm>)</emphasis>.
                This is a special id because it is not only
                unique locally to the node that generated it but it is unique across all the world.
                It is a combination of the network interfaceâ€™s <glossterm linkend="glos-mac">MAC address</glossterm>, the current date/time
                and a random number. Every time you create a new metadata in GeoNetwork, a new UUID
                is generated and assigned to it.</para>
            <para>Another important concept behind the harvesting is the <emphasis>last change date</emphasis>. 
                Every time you change a metadata, its last change date is
                updated. Just storing this parameter and comparing it with a new one allows any
                system to find out if the metadata has been modified since last update.</para>
            <para>These two concepts allow GeoNetwork to fetch a remote metadata, check if it has
                been updated and remove it locally if it has been removed remotely. Furthermore,
                thanks to UUIDs, a hierarchy of harvesting nodes can be built where B harvests from
                C and A harvests from B. Even loops can be created because harvested metadata cannot
                be modified.</para>

            <title>Harvesting life cycle</title>
            <para>When a harvesting node is set, there is no harvested metadata. During the first
                run, all remote matching metadata are retrieved and stored locally. After the first
                run, only changed metadata are retrieved. Harvested metadata are not editable for
                the following reasons:</para>

            <orderedlist>
                <listitem>
                    <para>The harvesting is periodic so any local change to harvested metadata will
                        be lost during the next run.</para>
                </listitem>
                <listitem>
                    <para>The change date is used to keep track of changes so if it gets changed
                        outside the originator site, the harvesting mechanism is compromised.</para>
                </listitem>
            </orderedlist>
            <para>Beside the metadata itself, this implies that users cannot change all other
                metadata properties (like categories, privileges etc...).</para>
            <para>The harvesting process goes on until one of the following situations arises:</para>

            <orderedlist>
                <listitem>
                    <para>An administrator stops (deactivates) the node.</para>
                </listitem>
                <listitem>
                    <para>An exception arises. In this case the node is automatically
                    stopped.</para>
                </listitem>
            </orderedlist>
            <para>When a harvesting node is removed, all harvest metadata are removed too.</para>

        </section>
        <section>
            <title>Multiple harvesting and hierarchies</title>
            <para>Catalogues that provide UUIDs for metadata (for example GeoNetwork and a CSW
                server) can be harvested several times without having to take care about metadata
                overlap. This allows the possibility to perform a thematic search and a metadata
                belonging to multiple searches is harvested only once and not duplicated.</para>
            <para>This mechanism allows the GeoNetwork harvesting type to be combined with other
                GeoNetwork nodes to perform hierarchical harvesting. This way a metadata can be
                harvested from several nodes. For example, consider this scenario:</para>

            <orderedlist>
                <listitem>
                    <para>Node (A) has created metadata (a)</para>
                </listitem>
                <listitem>
                    <para>Node (B) harvests (a) from (A)</para>
                </listitem>
                <listitem>
                    <para>Node (C) harvests (a) from (B)</para>
                </listitem>
                <listitem>
                    <para>Node (D) harvests from both (A), (B) and (C)</para>
                </listitem>
            </orderedlist>
            <para>In this scenario, Node (D) will get the same metadata (a) from all 3 nodes (A),
                (B), (C). The metadata will flow to (D) following 3 different paths but thanks to
                its UUID only one copy will be stored. When (a) will be changed in (A), a new
                version will flow to (D) but, thanks to the change date, the copy in (D) will be
                updated with the most recent version.</para>

                <para>If the harvesting succeeds, a tool tip will show detailed information about the

                    or if there is something to fix to the harvesting parameters or somewhere else.
                    The result tip is like a table, where each row refers to</para>
                <para>Total This is the total number of metadata found remotely. Metadata with the
                    same id are considered as one. Added Number of metadata added to the system
                    because they were not present locally. Removed Number of metadata that have been
                    removed locally because they are not present in the remote server anymore.
                    Updated Number of metadata that are present locally but that needed to be
                    updated because their last change date was different from the remote one.
                    Unchanged Local metadata left unchanged. Their remote last change date did not
                    change. Unknown schema Number of skipped metadata because their format was not
                    recognised by GeoNetwork. Unretrievable Number of metadata that were ready to be
                    retrieved from the remote server but for some reason there was an exception
                    during the data transfer process. Bad Format Number of skipped metadata because
                    they did not have a valid XML representation. Does not validate Number of
                    metadata which did not validate against their schema. These metadata were
                    harvested with success but skipped due to the validation process. Usually,
                    there is an option to force validation: if you want to harvest these metadata
                    anyway, simply turn it off.</para>

            	a standard search using the common query fields and to import all matching metadata. 
            	Furthermore, the protocol will try to keep both remote privileges and categories of 
            	the harvested metadata if they exist locally. Please notice that since GeoNetwork 2.1 
            	the harvesting protocol has been improved. This means that it is not possible to use 
            	this protocol to harvest from version 2.0 or below.</para>

                uses the web DAV (Distributed Authoring and Versioning) protocol to harvest metadata
                from a DAV server. It can be useful to users that want to publish their metadata
                through a web server that offers a DAV interface. The protocol allows to retrieve
                the contents of a web page (a list of files) with their change date.</para>

                <para>This type of harvesting allows you to connect to a GeoNetwork node, perform a
                    simple search as in the main page and retrieve all matched metadata. The search
                    is useful because it allows you to focus only on metadata of interest. Once you
                    add a node of this type, you will get a page like the one shown in <xref
                        linkend="admin_harvesting_gn"/>. The meaning of the options is the

                <para>Site Here you put information about the GeoNetworkâ€™s node you want to harvest
                    from (host, port and servlet). If you want to search protected metadata you have
                    to specify an account. The name parameter is just a short description that will
                    be shown in the main page beside each node. Search In this section you can
                    specify search parameters: they are the same present in the main page. Before
                    doing that, it is important to remember that the GeoNetworkâ€™s harvesting can be
                    hierarchical so a remote node can contain both its metadata and metadata
                    harvested from other nodes and sources. At the beginning, the Source drop down

                    of this button is to query GeoNetwork about all sources which it is currently
                    harvesting from. Once you get the drop down filled, you can choose a source name
                    to constrain the search to that source only. Leaving the drop down blank, the
                    search will spread over all metadata (harvested and not). You can add several
                    search criteria for each site through the Add button: several searches will be
                    performed and results merged. Each search box can be removed pressing the small
                    button on the left of the siteâ€™s name. If no search criteria is added, a global
                    unconstrained search will be performed. Options This is just a container for

                    Here you decide how to map remote groupâ€™s privileges. You can assign a copy
                    policy to each group. The Intranet group is not considered because it does not
                    make sense to copy its privileges. The All group has different policies from all

                    that the URL parameter here points to an OAI-PMH server. This is the entry point
                    that GeoNetwork will use to issue all PMH commands. Search This part allows you
                    to restrict the harvesting to specific metadata subsets. You can specify several
                    searches: GeoNetwork will execute them sequentially and results will be merged
                    to avoid the harvesting of the same metadata. Several searches allow you to
                    specify different search criteria. In each search, you can specify the following
                    parameters:</para>
                <para>From You can provide a start date here. All metadata whose last change date is
                    equal to or greater than this date will be harvested. You cannot simply edit
                    this field but you have to use the <inlinegraphic
                        fileref="images/icons/calendar.gif"/> icon to popup a calendar and choose
                    the date. This field is optional so if you donâ€™t provide it the start date
                    constraint is dropped. Use the <inlinegraphic
                        fileref="images/icons/clear_left.png"/> icon to clear the field. Until Works
                    exactly as the from parameter but adds an end constraint to the last change
                    date. The until date is included in the date range, the check is: less than or
                    equal to. Set An OAI-PMH server classifies its metadata into hierarchical sets.
                    You can request to return metadata that belong to only one set (and its
                    subsets). This narrows the search result. Initially the drop down shows only a
                    blank option that indicate <emphasis>no set</emphasis>. After specifying the
                    connection URL, you can press the Retrieve Info button, whose purpose is to
                    connect to the remote node, retrieve all supported sets and prefixes and fill
                    the search drop downs. After you have pressed this button, you can select a
                    remote set from the drop down. Prefix Here prefix means metadata format. The
                    oai_dc prefix is mandatory for any OAI-PMH compliant server, so this entry is
                    always present into the prefix drop down. To have this drop down filled with all
                    prefixes supported by the remote server, you have to enter a valid URL and press
                    the Retrieve Info button.</para>

                    option, when checked, will validate each harvested metadata against GeoNetworkâ€™s

                    1.0.0). The service URL is the URL of the service to contact (without parameters like 
                    "REQUEST=GetCapabilities", "VERSION=", ...). It has to be a valid URL 
                    like http://your.preferred.ogcservice/type_wms. 
                    The metadata language has to be specified. It will define the language of the metadata.
                    It should be the language used by the web service administrator.
                    The ISO topic category is used to populate the metadata. It is recommended to choose on
                    as the topic is mandatory for the ISO standard if the hierarchical level is "datasets".
