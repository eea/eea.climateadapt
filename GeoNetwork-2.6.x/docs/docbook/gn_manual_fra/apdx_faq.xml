                        <para>I am having difficulty installing multiple instances of GeoNetwork on
                            the same server</para>
                    </question>
                    <answer>
                        <para>To run multiple installation you have to change the ports that
                            GeoNetwork uses in order to avoid conflicts. The port are:</para>

                                    <para>This is the most probable source of conflicts. You have to
                                        edit the <literal>web/WEB-INF/config.xml</literal> file of the second
                                        installation and choose a value other than the default one,
                                        which is 2100. Use for example 2101 but keep in mind that
                                        remote nodes usually use 2100 so your second node will not
                                        be reachable. You cannot use the system configuration web
                                        form the first time because if the port conflicts, the
                                        server won't start.</para>

                            <ulink url="http://tomcat.apache.org/">Apache Tomcat</ulink> etc..) and by the DBMS used

                        <para>The logging is configured in the file <literal>../web/WEB-INF/log4j.cfg</literal> . You
                            can change the settings by editing the file in a text editor. For
                            operational systems it is suggested to put all log options to OFF or
                            FATAL. The log options are, with increasing log intensity:</para>

                        <para>The book "Producing Open Source Software" (shown in <xref
                                linkend="producingoss"/>) is a highly recommended book for anyone
                            working on open source software projects. It provides insight in all
                            aspects of FOSS development and on how to make a project successful. If
                            you are interested in participating in the GeoNetwork opensource
                            project, please spend some time reading through this book. It's
                            definitely worth the time and money (so buy the hardcopy if you can
                            afford it!).</para>

                        <para>Producing Open Source Software is a book about the human side of open
                            source development. It describes how successful projects operate, the
                            expectations of users and developers, and the culture of free software.</para>

                        <para>The book is available in bookstores and from the publisher (<ulink
