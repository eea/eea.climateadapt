            <para>The batch import facility allows you to import a set of metadata into the system
                all at once. In order to use this facility, you have to be logged in as an
                administrator. After the login step, go to the administration page and select the
                batch import’s link (<xref linkend="admin_batchimport_where"/>. The link is
                surrounded with a red rectangle). </para>

            <para>Clicking the link, you will reach the batch import’s page as illustrated in <xref
                    linkend="admin_batchimport_options"/>. You have to specify a set of parameters
                to make the import working. They are: </para>
            <para>Directory This is the full path on the server’s file system of the directory to
                scan. GeoNetwork will look for and try to import all XML files present into this
                directory. It is important to notice that this is the directory on the
                    <emphasis>server</emphasis> machine and <emphasis>not</emphasis> on the client
                of the user that is doing the import. All metadata files present into the import
                directory <emphasis>must</emphasis> have the same schema format. Schema GeoNetwork
                supports only some metadata formats so you have to specify the schema of the
                metadata you want to import. If a metadata does not belong to the selected schema,
                the entire operation will be aborted. Validate This is a simple validation step that
                you can choose to perform. The metadata is validated against its schema. Group You
                have to select a group to associate to the imported metadata. Usually the group is
                the creator of the metadata set. Category You can specify one category to associate
                to your metadata in order to simplify the search. Stylesheet This is a powerfull
                option because allows you to specify a stylesheet for an XSL transformation. The
                drop down control is filled with files taken from the web/xsl/conversion/import
                folder : all XSL files you put there will be made available. This is a dymanic
                process so you don’t have to restart GeoNetwork. The purpose of this option is to
                allow the conversion of a metadata into a suitable format that is supported by
                GeoNetwork. Therefore, it is important that the result of the transformation matches
                the schema format selected above. </para>
            <para>Below the page, there are the following buttons: </para>
            <para>Back Goes back to the administration form. Upload Starts the import process. When
                the process ends, the total count of imported metadata will be shown. Please notice
                that the import is transactional: the metadata set will be fully imported or fully
                discarded (there are no partial imports). Files that starts with ’.’ or that do not
                end with ’.xml’ are ignored. </para>

                <para>An hidden feature of the batch import is the possibility to specify some
                    import parameters in more detail. This feature is triggered when the specified
                    folder contains the import-config.xml file. When this happen, this file is read
                    and the standard import switches to the structured one. </para>
                <para>The import-config.xml file has a config root element with the following
                    children: </para>

                <para>The import procedure starts by scanning the provided directory. This can
                    contain, beside the import-config.xml file, only subdirectories which name will
                    be ignored but used only as a container. Inside each directory, there is another
                    level made only by directories that represent a metadata grouping for
                    categories. Each directory name will be used as the dir attribute in the mapping
                    scheme previously described. </para>
