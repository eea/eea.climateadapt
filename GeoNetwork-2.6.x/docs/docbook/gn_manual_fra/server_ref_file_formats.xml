        <title>Metadata Exchange Format v1.1</title>
        <section>
            <title>Introduction</title>
            <para>The metadata exchange format (MEF in short) is a special designed file format
                whose purpose is to allow metadata exchange between different platforms. A metadata
                exported into this format can be imported by any platform which is able to
                understand it. This format has been developed with GeoNetwork in mind so the
                information it contains is mainly related to it. Nevertheless, it can be used as an
                interoperability format between any platform. </para>
            <para>This format has been designed with these needs in mind: </para>

            <para>A MEF file is simply a ZIP file which contains the following files: </para>

            <orderedlist>
                <listitem>
                    <para>metadata.xml : this file contains the metadata itself, in XML format. The
                        text encoding of the metadata is that one specified into the XML
                        declaration. </para>
                </listitem>
                <listitem>
                    <para>info.xml : this is a special XML file which contains information related
                        to the metadata but that cannot be stored into it. Examples of such
                        information are the creation date, the last change date, privileges on the
                        metadata and so on. Now this information is related to the GeoNetwork’s
                        architecture. </para>

                <listitem>
                    <para>public : this is a directory used to store the metadata thumbnails and
                        other public files. There are no restrictions on the images’ format but it
                        is strongly recommended to use the portable network graphics (PNG), the JPEG
                        or the GIF formats. </para>
                </listitem>
                <listitem>
                    <para>private : this is a directory used to store all data (maps, shape files
                        etc...) associated to the metadata. Files in this directory are
                            <emphasis>private</emphasis> in the sense that an authorization is
                        required to access them. There are no restrictions on the file types that
                        can be stored into this directory.</para>
                </listitem>
            </orderedlist>
            <para>Any other file or directory present into the MEF file should be ignored by readers
                that don’t recognize them. This allows actors to add custom extensions to the MEF
                file. </para>
            <para>A MEF file can have empty public and private folders depending on the export
                format, which can be: </para>

            <title>The info.xml file</title>
            <para>This file contains general information about a metadata. It must have an info root
                element with a mandatory version attribute. This attribute must be in the X.Y form,
                where X represents the major version and Y the minor one. The purpose of this
                attribute is to allow future changes of this format maintaining compatibility with
                older readers. The policy behind the version is this: </para>

                <listitem>
                    <para>A change to Y means a minor change. All existing elements in the previous
                        version must be left unchanged: only new elements or attributes may be
                        added. A reader capable of reading version X.Y is also capable of reading
                        version X.Y’ with Y’>Y. </para>

                                when omitted, the reader should generate one. A metadata without a
                                uuid can be imported several times into the same system without
                                breaking uniqueness constraints. When missing, the reader should

                            <para>localId : This is an optional element. If present, indicates the
                                id used locally by the sourceId actor to store the metadata. Its
                                purpose is just to allow the reuse of the same local id when
                                reimporting a metadata. </para>
                        </listitem>
                        <listitem>
                            <para>isTemplate : A boolean field that indicates if this metadata is a
                                template used to create new ones. There is no real distinction
                                between a real metadata and a template but some actors use it to
                                allow fast metadata creation. The value must be: {
                                <emphasis>true</emphasis>, <emphasis>false</emphasis> }. </para>
                        </listitem>
                        <listitem>
                            <para>rating : This is an optional element. If present, indicates the
                                users’ rating of the metadata ranging from 1 (a bad rating) to 5 (an
                                excellent rating). The special value 0 means that the metadata has
                                not been rated yet. Can be used to sort search results. </para>

                        <listitem>
                            <para>popularity : Another optional value. If present, indicates the
                                popularity of the metadata. The value must be positive and high
                                values mean high popularity. The criteria used to set the popularity
                                is left to the writer. Its main purpose is to provide a metadata
                                ordering during a search.</para>

                <listitem>
                    <para>categories : a container for categories associated to this metadata. A
                        category is just a name, like ’audio-video’ that classifies the metadata to
                        allow an easy search. Each category is specified by a category element which
                        must have a name attribute. This attribute is used to store the category’s
                        name. If there are no categories, the categories element will be empty.
                    </para>

                <listitem>
                    <para>privileges : a container for privileges associated to this metadata.
                        Privileges are operations that a group (which represents a set of users) can
                        do on a metadata and are specified by a set of group elements. Each one of
                        these, has a mandatory name attribute to store the group’s name and a set of
                        operation elements used to store the operations allowed on the metadata.
                        Each operation element must have a name attribute which value must belong to
                        the following set: { <emphasis>view</emphasis>,
                        <emphasis>download</emphasis>, <emphasis>notify</emphasis>,
                            <emphasis>dynamic</emphasis>, <emphasis>featured</emphasis> }. If there
                        are no groups or the actor does not have the concept of group, the
                        privileges element will be empty. A group element without any operation
                        element must be ignored by readers. </para>

                <listitem>
                    <para>public : All metadata thumbnails (and any other public file) must be
                        listed here. This container contains a file element for each file. Mandatory
                        attributes of this element are name, which represents the file’s name and
                        changeDate, which contains the date of the latest change to the file. The
                        public element is optional but, if present, must contain all the files
                        present in the metadata’s public directory and any reader that imports these
                        files must set the latest change date on these using the provided ones. The
                        purpose of this element is to provide more information in the case the MEF
                        format is used for metadata harvesting. </para>
