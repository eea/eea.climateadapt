            <title>Localization of dynamic user interface elements</title>
            <para>The user interface of GeoNetwork can be localized into several languages through
                XML language files. But beside static text, there is also more dynamic text that can
                be added and changed interactively. This text is stored in the database and is
                translated using the localization form that is part of the administrative functions
                    (<xref linkend="admin_localization_where"/>). </para>

            <para>The form allows you to localize the following entities:
                    <emphasis>Groups</emphasis>, <emphasis>Categories</emphasis>,
                    <emphasis>Operations</emphasis> and <emphasis>Regions</emphasis>. The form
                    (<xref linkend="admin_localization_form"/>) subdivided in a left and a right
                panel. </para>
            <para>The left panel allows you to choose which elements you want to edit. On the top, a
                dropdown let you choose which entity to edit. All elements of the selected type are
                shown in a list. </para>
            <para>When you select an element from the list, the right panel will show the text as it
                will be displayed in the user interface. The text in the source language is read
                only while you can update the text in the target language field. </para>
            <note>
                <para>You can change the source and target languages to best suit your needs. Some
                    users may for instance prefer to translate from French to Spanish, others prefer
                    to work with English as the source language.</para>
            </note>
            <para>Use the Save button to store the updated label and move to the next
                element.</para>
            <important>
                <para>If the user changes a label and chooses another target language without
                    saving, the label change is lost.</para>
