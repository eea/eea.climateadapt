            <title>Introduction</title>
            <para>Starting from release 2.1.0, GeoNetwork has a new metadata access policy. The old
                edit and admin privileges have been removed and the concept of reviewer has been
                introduced. The purpose of this new profile is to control when a metadata can be
                published outside or not. In previous releases, all users belonging to a group with
                edit privileges could edit the same metadata. Now, a metadata is only visible to its
                creator, to a reviewer which has access to the group owner and to an
                administrator.</para>

            <title>Ownership transfer</title>
            <para>A typical need that arises when a user is dismissed is to transfer all their
                metadata to another user into another group. To fill this need, the transfer
                ownership functionality has been introduced. This is located in the administration
                page (<xref linkend="admin_ownership_where"/>) and once selected, leads to the page
                shown in <xref linkend="admin_ownership_options"/>.</para>

                <title> How to reach the transfer ownership page </title>

                </mediaobject>
            </figure>

            <para>Initially, the page shows only a drop down for a Source editor. The drop down is
                filled with all GeoNetwork’s users which are editors and own some metadata.
                Selecting an editor means selecting all metadata that belong to that editor. An
                empty drop down means that there are no editors with metadata associated and hence
                no transfer is possible.</para>
            <para>Note The drop down will be filled with all editors visible to you. If you are not
                an administrator, you will view only a subset of all editors.</para>

            <figure id="admin_ownership_options">
                <title> The transfer ownership page </title>
                <mediaobject>
                    <imageobject>
                        <imagedata fileref="images/admin/web-ownership-options.png" width="9cm"
                            align="center"/>
                    </imageobject>
                </mediaobject>
            </figure>

            <para>Once a source editor has been selected, a set of rows is displayed. Each row
                refers to an editor’s group for which there are privileges. The meaning of each
                column is the following:</para>
            <para>Source group This is a group that has privileges in the metadata that belong to
                the source editor. Put in another way, if one of the editor’s metadata has
                privileges for one group, that group is listed here. Target group This is the
                destination group of the transfering process. All privileges relative to the source
                group are transferred to the target group. The target group drop down is filled with
                all groups visible to the logged user (tipically an administrator or a user
                administrator). By default, the source group is selected in the target drop down.
                Privileges to groups All and Intranet are not transferrable. Target editor Once a
                target group is selected, this drop down is filled with all editors that belong to
                that target group. Operation Actually only the Transfer operation is
                possible.</para>
            <para>By selecting the Transfer operation, if the source group is different than the
                target group, the system performs the ownership transfer, shows a brief summary and
                removes the current row because now there are no privileges to transfer
                anymore.</para>
