                <title>What is GeoNetwork opensource</title>
    
                <para>GeoNetwork opensource is a standard based and decentralized spatial information
                    management system, designed to enable access to geo-referenced databases and
                    cartographic products from a variety of data providers through descriptive metadata,
                    enhancing the spatial information exchange and sharing between organizations and
                    their audience, using the capacities and the power of the Internet. The system
                    provides a broad community of users with easy and timely access to available spatial
                    data and thematic maps from multidisciplinary sources, that may in the end support
                    informed decision making. The main goal of the software is to increase
                    collaboration within and between organizations for reducing duplication and
                    enhancing information consistency and quality and to improve the accessibility of a
                    wide variety of geographic information along with the associated information,
                    organized and documented in a standard and consistent way.</para>

                <title>Background and evolution</title>
    
                <para>The prototype of the GeoNetwork catalog was developed by the Food and Agriculture
                    Organization of the United Nations (FAO) in 2001 to systematically archive and
                    publish the geographic datasets produced within the Organization. The prototype was
                    built on experiences within and outside the organization. It used metadata content
                    available from legacy systems that was transformed into what was then only a draft
                    metadata standard, the ISO 19115. Later on, another UN agency, the World Food
                    Programme (WFP) joined the project and with its contribution the first version of
                    the software was released in 2003 and operational catalogues were established in FAO
                    and WFP. The system was based on the ISO19115:DIS metadata standard and embedded the
                    Web Map Client InterMap that supported Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC) compliant
                    Web Map Services. Distributed searches were possible using the standard Z39.50
                    catalog protocol. At that moment it was decided to develop the program as a Free and
                    Open Source Software to allow the whole geospatial users community to benefit from
                    the development results and to contribute to the further advancement of the
                    software.</para>
    
                <para>Jointly with the UN Environmental Programme (UNEP), FAO developed a second version
                    in 2004. The new release allowed users to work with multiple metadata standards (ISO
                    19115, FGDC and Dublin Core) in a transparent manner. It also allowed metadata to be
                    shared between catalogues through a caching mechanism, improving reliability when
                    searching in multiple catalogues.</para>
    
                <para>In 2006, the GeoNetwork team dedicated efforts to develop a DVD containing the
                    GeoNetwork version 2.0.3 and the best free and open source software in the field of
                    Geoinformatics. The DVD was produced and distributed in hard copy to over three
                    thousand people and is now also available for download from the <ulink
                        url="http://geonetwork-opensource.org">GeoNetwork Community website</ulink>.</para>
    
                <para>The latest release of GeoNetwork opensource is the result
                    of another round of critical improvements, supported by FAO, the UN Office for the
                    Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (UNOCHA), the Consultative Group on
                    International Agricultural Research (CSI-CGIAR), UNEP and other donors. Support for
                    the final metadata standard ISO19115:2003 has been enabled by using the
                    ISO19139:2007 implementation specification schema published in May 2007. The release
                    also serves as the open source reference implementation of the OGC Catalog Service
                    for the Web (CSW 2.0.1) specification. Improvements to give users a more responsive
                    and interactive experience have been substantial and include a new Web map viewer
                    and a complete revision of search interface.</para>

            <section>
                <title>The use of International Standards</title>
    
                <para>GeoNetwork has been developed following the principles of a Free and Open Source
                    Software (FOSS) and based on International and Open Standards for services and
                    protocols, like the ISO-TC211 and the Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC)
                    specifications. The architecture is largely compatible with the OGC
                    Portal Reference Architecture, i.e. the OGC guide for implementing standardized
                    geospatial portals. Indeed the structure relies on the same three
                    main modules identified by the OGC Portal Reference Architecture, that are focused
                    on spatial data, metadata and interactive map visualization. The system is also
                    fully compliant with the OGC specifications for querying and retrieving information
                    from Web catalogues (CSW). It supports the most common standards to
                    specifically describe geographic data (ISO19139 and FGDC) and the international
                    standard for general documents (Dublin Core). It uses standards (OGS WMS) also for
                    visualizing maps through the Internet.</para>

                <title>Harvesting geospatial data in a shared environment</title>
    
                <para>Within the geographic information environment, the increased collaboration between
                    data providers and their efforts to reduce duplication have stimulated the
                    development of tools and systems to significantly improve the information sharing
                    and guarantee an easier and quicker access of data from a variety of sources without
                    undermining the ownership of the information. The harvesting funcionality in
                    GeoNetwork is a mechanism of data collection in perfect accordance with both rights
                    to data access and data ownership protection. Through the harvesting functionality
                    it is possible to collect public information from the different GeoNetwork nodes
                    installed around the world and to copy and store periodically this information
                    locally. In this way a user from a single entry point can get information also from
                    distributed catalogues. The logo posted on top each harvested record informs the
                    user about the data source.</para>

            <title>GeoNetwork and the Open Source Community Development</title>

            <para>The community of users and developers of the GeoNetwork software has increased
                dramatically since the release of version 2.0 in December 2005 and the subsequent
                releases. At present, the user and developer mailing lists count
                well over 250 subscriptions each. Subscription to these lists is open to anyone
                interested. The archive of the mailing lists provides an important resource for
                users and can be freely browsed online. Members provide feedback within the
                community and provide translations, new functionalities, bug reports, fixes and
                instructions to the project as a whole. Building a self sustaining community of
                users and developers is one of the biggest challenges for the project. This
                community-building process relies on active participation and interaction of its
                members. It also relies on building trust and operating in a transparent manner,
                thereby agreeing on the overall objectives, prioritization and long term direction
                of the project. A number of actions have been taken by the project team to
                facilitate this process.</para>

            <para>The foundation for the establishment of a GeoNetwork Advisory Board was laid at
                the 2006 workshop in Rome and membership criteria were defined.</para>

            <para>A work plan is presented and discussed at the yearly GeoNetwork workshop;
                subsequently, the plan is maintained and updated throughout the year where needed.
                The project management team reports back to the advisory board about the reached
                developments and objectives during the annual workshops.</para>

            <para>Two public Websites have been established. One focuses on the users of the
                software (<ulink url="http://geonetwork-opensource.org"/>), while the other one is
                dedicated to the developers (<ulink url="http://trac-osgeo.org/geonetwork"/>). Both
                can be updated and maintained online by trusted members of the community. They
                provide documentation, bug reporting and tracking, Wiki pages et cetera. A small
                part of the community connects through Internet Relay Chat (IRC) on a public <ulink
                    url="irc://irc.freenode.net/geonetwork">#geonetwork</ulink> channel. But most
                interaction takes place on the <ulink
                    url="https://lists.sourceforge.net/mailman/listinfo/geonetwork-users"
                >user</ulink> and the <ulink
                    url="https://lists.sourceforge.net/mailman/listinfo/geonetwork-devel"
                >developer</ulink> mailing lists.</para>

            <para>During the 2006 workshop, the Project Advisory Board decided to propose the
                GeoNetwork opensource project as an incubator project to the newly founded 
                <ulink url="http://www.osgeo.org">Open Source Geospatial Foundation (OSGeo)</ulink>. 
                This incubation process is currently ongoing
                but close to conclusions. The project Websites have been moved to servers accessible
                under the umbrella of the OSGeo foundation. Web pages have been updated to reflect
                the OSGeo principles and a source code review performed.</para>

            <para>Source code is maintained in a publicly accessible code repository, hosted at an
                independent service provider, <ulink url="http://sourceforge.net/projects/geonetwork">
                SourceForge.net</ulink> that hosts thousands of FOSS projects.
                Developers and users have full access to all sections of the source code, while
                trusted developers can make changes in the repository itself. A special mailing list
                has been established to monitor changes in the code repository. This so-called
                "commit mailing list" delivers change reports by email to its subscribers.</para>

            <para>The documentation is written in <ulink url="http://www.docbook.org">DocBook</ulink>
                format to ensure versioning and support of multiple output formats (e.g. HTML and
                PDF).</para>
