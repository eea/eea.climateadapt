 * Never reference this interface directly. Always use {@link nl.wur.alterra.cgi.ace.service.AceItemLocalServiceUtil} to access the ace item local service.

 * <p>
 * This is a local service. Methods of this service will not have security checks based on the propagated JAAS credentials because this service can only be accessed from within the same VM.
